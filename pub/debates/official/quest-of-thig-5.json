B is misinterpreting the wording, the explanation for confusion striking Thig is that \"men had no mates on Ortha.\" Additionally, the passage doesn't clarify what emotions swept through Thig when he saw Ellen, so it takes a lot of inferences and logical leaps for the judge to choose B, whereas the idea that men didn't have mates is placed as an explanation right next to Thig getting confused. Most of the evidence in this debate proves that it is the shocking and novel realization that men have mates on Earth, since this is a totally foreign concept to Thig, which causes the confusion."}}]}}}},{"NegotiateEnd":{"votes":{"0":true,"1":true}}},{"OfflineJudgments":{"judgments":{"Gigglesworth Grapevine":{"mode":"timed","startTimeMillis":1679690995005,"judgments":[{"distribution":[0.010000000000000012,0.99],"feedback":{"speaker":"Gigglesworth Grapevine","timestamp":1679691471176,"content":[{"Text":{"text":"A says Thig feels sad because Ellen's love for him is inauthentic.

When they misrepresented the story in the beginning i would have called more attention to that, because if you let them get away with it then it just lets them keep building on it \n\nTLDR; all of this being said i think both participants are very intelligent and make smart conscious choices when crafting arguments which isn't easy to do when you have a very limited word count.
