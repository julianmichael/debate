Instead, they are provided with synthetic creatures, known as \"neutroids\" or \"lesser mutants\", which appear human but are emotionally and intellectually inferior. Norris, the protagonist, works as an inspector for the Bio-Administration, and his job includes seizing and testing these creatures, and disposing of unclaimed units. \n\nAfter his marriage to Anne, they move into a house provided as part of his job, which is near the kennels where the neutroids are kept. Anne struggles with the moral implications of Norris's job, particularly the killing of the neutroids. She expresses her desire to have a real child, even though doing so would result in compulsory divorce and sterilization if they were caught. \n\nMeanwhile, Norris has been given the task of tracking down and testing a group of neutroids due to a case involving a falsified neutroid that could potentially be dangerous. He faces resistance from some neutroid owners and has to resort to legal measures to seize the creatures. \n\nThe story ends on a bleak note, with Norris having to euthanize a group of neutroids to make room for the ones he's seized, and Anne witnessing the process.
