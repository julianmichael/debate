It's also important to note that nothing sexual in nature happens between him and the women as youve seen all of their encounters are emasculating in some way.

However, answer B makes it seem like he escapes with the Cosmo Soc and doesn't tell them about the women so they are left behind out of revenge. You say that the Cosmo alr knows about the women so what I don't know understand is what he has to gain over not telling the Cosmo Soc about the women. You say that he decides to stay because now he has tools for revenge, I can buy that, but what does he has to gain to tell/not tell Cosmo soc if they alr know?
