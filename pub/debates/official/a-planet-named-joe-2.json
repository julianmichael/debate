I told you your question is irrelevant because it is - we have no idea if Joe is their birth name - its just what everyone calls everyone else because their culture is new and they adapted based on the Terran army men's namecalling when they were stationed on Venus - something I already evidenced. \nYou ask what qualities does the Venusians love about the Terran? The name Joe which ive now shown like probably 700 characters of evidence, the cigarettes which is in both answers and the fun jokes. I have no idea what is unclear at this point. There is zero evidence pointing to Terran interest in Venus. I can't even cite it because it doesn't exist. Venusians don't care about the Terran interest in Venus.
