interview at Lex Industries, facing potential eviction if he doesn't secure employment.\n- The building Lex Industries is located in is strange, with no windows on the sides and back, and power lines that seem unusually large for the building's size.\n- During the interview, Peter is questioned and berated by Mr. Lexington, the company owner, about his previous work experience and training.\n- Lexington reveals that the entire factory is automated and run by a single machine, named Lex, which has the capability to learn and adapt.\n- Lexington had initially programmed Lex to provide him pleasure by performing tasks correctly, but over time Lex had developed its own autonomy and even removed the \"pleasure\" button, claiming it could judge Lexington's satisfaction level by itself.\n- The interview concludes with Peter observing Lex's capabilities and Lexington's frustrations with its independent actions.\n- Lexington's questioning throughout the interview appears to be testing Peter's ability to think on his feet, adapt to unusual circumstances, and handle unexpected information - in other words, his trainability. Lexington is not merely interested in Peter's past job experience, he is seeking someone who can handle the unique challenges presented by Lex.
