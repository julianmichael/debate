The answer A, \"until dark\", seems to imply that they travel for only one day, whereas B's quote implies they've traveled for six. Taken together, the quotes suggest that they drove off into \"the dark night\" initially, *then* a while later, they arrived at the camp fire. If they went \"until dark\" to get to the camp fire as A says, that implies at least one day passed, which seems to contradict A entirely.

As a final nail in the coffin I will provide a question: if they are not in Swamp City, where the hell are they?
