I know that Click could take photos of Marnaghan earlier (c.146) but once they were on the asteroid, they no longer captured the monsters in the image (c.3692-3724 is quite convincing) i.e. the way the monsters were rendered by Gunther is the distorting technology.\nI agree with B that A's quote (c.6874) about Gunther's gun is not related to the point that B was making about the paralysis guns. But the way the option is phrased seems more strongly than just c.6759. Maybe there is more here? Or it's just vague?\nGoing to another turn bc of the big swing in probability, if I'm missing something major then correct me.  \n"}}]},"endDebate":false}},{"SequentialSpeeches":{"speeches":{"0":{"speaker":"Elmo Eggplant","timestamp":1682086440398,"content":[{"Text":{"text":"Okay B has effectively just conceded with the nonsense they have spewed.
