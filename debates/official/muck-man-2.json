I think question 2 on why Answer B is a plausible alternative is most pertinent. The question here is the \"primary benefit\" of becoming a changeling, this is important because the story, like I mentioned before does indeed talk about how there is a changeling program that Asa takes in order to reduce his prison sentence. However, Asa's motivations hints that option B is a secondary benefit rather than a primary benefit for him. I.e. becoming a changeling would get you superhuman powers which you would then use to efficiently work or reduce your prison sentence. \n\nNext, I will discuss question 1 on \"advantages of changeling bodies\" quote and the other characters in the story that goes through the process. Tom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne (daughter of the company's boss) are the two other major characters in the story. The two of them are well off and depended on the changeling technology to gain superhuman regenerative abilities—the main use they had outside of laboring.
