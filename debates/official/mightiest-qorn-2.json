in Concordiat","\n"," times, perhaps two hundred years ago.","They vanished as suddenly as","\n"," they had appeared.","There was no record of where they went.\" He paused","\n"," for effect.","\n","\n"," \"They have now reappeared—occupying the inner planet of this system!\"","\n","\n"," \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered.","\"That's uninhabited","\n"," Terrestrial

him, harrumphed and read aloud:","\n","\n"," His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the","\n"," Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the","\n","

steel and fire.","Receive,","\n"," Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,","\n"," and let Those who dare gird for the contest.","\n","\n"," \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.","\n","\n"," Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.","\n","\n"," \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"","\n","\n"," \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out—\" the Military Attache","\n"," began.","\n","\n"," \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on","\n"," the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in.","He paused, waiting for interested","\n"," frowns to settle into place.","\n","\n"," \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial","\n"," controlled soil—and without so much as a flicker from the instruments","\n"," of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"","\n","\n"," The Military Attache blinked.","\"That's absurd,\" he said flatly.","Nitworth","\n"," slapped the table.","\n","\n"," \"We're up against something new, gentlemen!","I've considered every","\n"," hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel!","The fact is—the","\n"," Qornt fleets are indetectible!\"","\n","The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip.","\"In that case, we can't","\n"," try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive","\n"," of our own.","I recommend a crash project.","In the meantime—\"","\n","\n"," \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the","\n"," Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up.","\"I'll fit out a","\n"," couple of volunteers with plastic beaks—\"","\n","\n"," \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen!","Long range policy will be","\n"," worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the

recommendation?\"","\n","\n"," The Political Officer placed his fingertips together.","\"What about a","\n"," stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"","\n","\n"," \"No!","No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected.","\"I'd say a calm,","\n"," dignified, aggressive withdrawal—as soon as possible.\"","\n","\n"," \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the

the","\n"," Political Officer.","\"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk","\n"," by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.","\n"," Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room.","Magnan","\n"," eased toward the door.","\n","\n"," \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.","\n","\n"," \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq.","It","\n"," was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr.","Ambassador.","Be sure to","\n"," let us know how it works out.\"","\n","\n"," \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly.","\"A number of","\n"," chores remain to be assigned.","I think you, Magnan, need a little field","\n"," experience.","I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at

Retief,\" Nitworth said.","Retief turned.","\n","\n"," \"Try to restrain Mr.","Magnan from any impulsive moves—in any","\n"," direction.\"","\n","II","\n","\n"," Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope","\n"," of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among","\n"," flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of","\n"," white beach with the blue sea beyond.","\n","\n"," \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face.","\"A pity we","\n"," couldn't locate the Qornt.","We'll go back now and report—\"","\n","\n"," \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said.","\"Why","\n"," don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can","\n"," observe.\"","\n","\n"," \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission.","This is not a time to","\n"," think of sightseeing.\"","\n","\n"," \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"","\n","\n"," \"See here, Retief!","One might almost receive the impression that you're","\n"," questioning Corps policy!\"","\n","\n"," \"One might, at that.","The Qornt have made their play, but I think it","\n"," might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold.","If I'm","\n"," not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"","\n","\n"," \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"","\n","\n"," \"It's directly down-slope—\" Retief broke off, listening.","Magnan","\n"," clutched at his arm.","\n","\n"," There was a sound of crackling foliage.","Twenty feet ahead, a leafy","\n"," branch swung aside.","An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,","\n"," green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like","\n"," steps.","A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set","\n"," among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak.","The crest bobbed","\n"," as the creature cocked its head, listening.","\n","\n"," Magnan gulped audibly.","The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed","\n"," directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of","\n"," a giant trunk.","\n","\n"," \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked.","He whirled and took three leaps","\n"," into the brush.","\n","\n"," A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way.","He spun,","\n"," darted to the left.","The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its","\n"," narrow chest.","Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,","\n"," turned—and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the","\n"," right.","All three went down in a tangle of limbs.","\n","\n"," Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and","\n"," stopped, right fist cocked.","The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.","\n","\n"," \"Nice piece of work, Mr.","Magnan,\" Retief said.","\"You nailed both of","\n"," them.\"","\n","\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless","\n"," countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.","\n"," \"It hardly seems fair.","Eight feet tall","\n","and","\n","faces like that!\"","\n","\n"," The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over","\n"," a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green","\n"," trousers.","\n","\n"," \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing","\n"," Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked.","\"Small thanks to","\n"," you.\"","\n","\n"," Magnan smiled loftily.","\"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering","\n"," with peaceable diplomats in future.\"","\n","\n"," \"Diplomats?","Surely you jest.\"","\n","\n"," \"Never mind us,\" Retief said.","\"It's you fellows we'd like to talk","\n"," about.","How many of you are there?\"","\n","\n"," \"Only Zubb and myself.\"","\n","\n"," \"I mean altogether.","How many Qornt?\"","\n","\n"," The alien whistled shrilly.","\n","\n"," \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.","\n","\n"," \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"","\n","\n"," \"You find the situation amusing?","I assure you, sir, you are in perilous","\n"," straits at the moment.","I","\n","may","\n","fly into another rage, you know.\"","\n","\n"," \"Please, restrain yourself.","I was merely somewhat astonished—\" a small","\n"," whistle escaped—\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"","\n","\n"," \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"","\n","\n"," \"I?","Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped","\n"," the beaked face.","\"Both Zubb and I are Verpp.","Naturalists, as it","\n"," happens.\"","\n","\n"," \"You certainly","\n","look","\n","like Qornt.\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh, not at all—except perhaps to a Terrestrial.","The Qornt are","\n"," sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height.","And, of course,","\n"," they do nothing but quarrel.","A drone caste, actually.\"","\n","\n"," \"A caste?","You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"","\n","\n"," \"Not at all!","A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"","\n","\n"," \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock—descended from a","\n"," common ancestor, perhaps.\"","\n","\n"," \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"","\n","\n"," \"What are the differences between you, then?\"","\n","\n"," \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation","\n"," for the finer things of life.","One dreads to contemplate descending to","\n","their","\n","level.\"","\n","\n"," \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador","\n"," at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked.","\n","The beak twitched.","\"Smorbrod?","I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"","\n","\n"," \"The outer planet of this system.\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh, yes.","We call it Guzzum.","I had heard that some sort of creatures","\n"," had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to","\n"," such matters.\"","\n","\n"," \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said.","\"We must truss these chaps","\n"," up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape.","You heard what they","\n"," said.\"","\n","\n"," \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"","\n"," Retief asked.","\n","\n"," \"At Tarroon, you mean?","Oh, yes.","Planning some adventure.\"","\n","\n"," \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said.","\"And unless we","\n"," hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the","\n"," evacuees!\"","\n","\n"," \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh, a very large number.","Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"","\n","\n"," \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.","\n","\n"," \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"","\n","\n"," \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in","\n"," all?\"","\n","\n"," Another whistle.","\"Not at all.","I was referring to the local Qornt only.","\n"," There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"","\n","\n"," \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum—unilaterally?\"","\n","\n"," \"I suppose so;","it sounds like them.","A truculent group, you know.","And","\n"," interplanetary relations","\n","are","\n","rather a hobby of theirs.\"","\n","\n"," Zubb moaned and stirred.","He sat up slowly, rubbing his head.","He spoke","\n"," to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.","\n","\n"," \"What did he say?\"","\n","\n"," \"Poor Zubb.","He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to","\n"," gather you as specimens.\"","\n","\n"," \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking","\n"," creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.","\n","\n"," \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.","\n","\n"," \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"","\n","\n"," \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said.","\"Such a quaint, archaic","\n"," accent.\"","\n","\n"," \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked.","\"What kind of","\n"," reception would we get?\"","\n","\n"," \"That depends.","I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the","\n"," Rheuk;","it's their nest-mending time, you know.","The Boog will be busy","\n"," mating—such a tedious business—and of course the Qornt are tied up","\n"," with their ceremonial feasting.","I'm afraid no one will take any notice","\n"," of you.\"","\n","\n"," \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who","\n"," have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne—who","\n"," openly avow their occupied world—would ignore Terrestrials in their","\n"," midst?\"","\n","\n"," \"If at all possible.\"","\n","\n"," Retief got to his feet.","\n","\n"," \"I think our course is clear, Mr.","Magnan.","It's up to us to go down and","\n"," attract a little attention.\"","\n","III","\n","\n"," \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan","\n"," puffed, trotting at Retief's side.","\"These fellows Zubb and Slun—Oh,","\n"," they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led","\n"," into a trap?\"","\n","\n"," \"We can't.\"","\n","\n"," Magnan stopped short.","\"Let's go back.\"","\n","\n"," \"All right,\" Retief said.","\"Of course there may be an ambush—\"","\n","\n"," Magnan moved off.","\"Let's keep going.\"","\n","\n"," The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great","\n"," brush-grown mound.","Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the","\n"," hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.","\n","\n"," \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said.","\"You'll","\n"," excuse us, I hope—\"","\n","\n"," \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward.","\"I'll escort our guests to Qornt","\n"," Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp.","Slun twittered back.","\n","\n"," \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered.","\"Those fellows are","\n"," plotting mischief.\"","\n","\n"," \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan.","They're scared of you.\"","\n","\n"," \"That's true.","And the drubbing they received was well-deserved.","I'm a","\n"," patient man, but there are occasions—\"","\n","\n"," \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called.","\"Another ten minutes' walk—\"","\n","\n"," \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan","\n"," announced.","\"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your","\n"," military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"","\n","\n"," \"Yes, yes, of course.","Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"","\n","\n"," \"This is Tarroon?\"","\n","\n"," \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"","\n","\n"," \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan","\n"," muttered.","\"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.","\n","\n"," The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down","\n"," steeply, then leveled off and branched.","Zubb took the center branch,","\n"," ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what","\n"," appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.","\n","\n"," \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered.","\"These","\n"," creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"","\n","\n"," Ahead, Zubb slowed.","A distant susurration was audible, a sustained","\n"," high-pitched screeching.","\"Softly, now.","We approach Qornt Hall.","They","\n"," can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"","\n","\n"," \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.","\n","\n"," \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've","\n"," scheduled an invasion for next month.\"","\n","\n"," \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien.","\"How is it","\n"," that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this","\n"," sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"","\n","\n"," \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war.","They merely—\"","\n","\n"," \"Retief, this is fantastic!","I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques","\n"," before, but this is madness!\"","\n","\n"," \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the","\n"," yellow-lit corridor.","Retief and Magnan moved forward.","\n","The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval","\n"," chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with","\n"," tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed","\n"," spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power","\n"," rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals.","Great","\n"," guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length","\n"," of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror","\n"," polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and","\n"," paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles—and","\n"," cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.","\n","\n"," Lesser trolls—beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed—trotted briskly,","\n"," bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of","\n"," three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an","\n"," intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of","\n"," the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried","\n"," on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.","\n","\n"," \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.","\n"," \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"","\n","\n"," \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said.","\"Observe the Qornt—the tallest of the","\n"," feasters—he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"","\n","\n"," \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated.","\"And now we really","\n"," must hurry along—\"","\n","\n"," \"That one is chief among these rowdies.","I'm sure you'll want a word","\n"," with him.","He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from","\n"," the other Centers as well.\"","\n","\n"," \"What kind of vessels?","Warships?\"","\n","\n"," \"Certainly.","What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"","\n","\n"," \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,","\n"," tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels?","And how many units","\n"," comprise the fleet?","And where they're based at present?\"","\n","\n"," \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.","\n"," They mount a variety of weapons.","The Qornt are fond of that sort of","\n"," thing.","Each of the Qornt has his own, of course.","They're virtually","\n"," identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given","\n"," his ship.\"","\n","\n"," \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper.","\"It sounds as","\n"," though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set","\n"," of toy sailboats!\"","\n","\n"," Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall.","\"I can","\n"," see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"","\n","\n"," \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled.","\"If you'll","\n"," kindly step along, gentlemen....\"","\n","\n"," \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer","\n"," the matter to committee.\"","\n","\n"," \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss","\n"," having a cosy chat.\"","\n","\n"," There was a pause.","\n","\n"," \"Ah ...","Retief,\" Magnan said.","\"Zubb has just presented a most","\n"," compelling argument....\"","\n","Retief turned.","Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol","\n"," in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other.","Both were pointed at","\n"," Magnan's chest.","\n","\n"," \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.","\n","\n"," \"See here, Zubb!","We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.","\n","\n"," \"Careful, Mr.","Magnan;","you may goad him to a frenzy.\"","\n","\n"," \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled.","\"I much prefer to observe the frenzy","\n"," of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp","\n"," have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers.","If there's","\n"," anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others.","Now","\n"," step along, please.\"","\n","\n"," \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"","\n","\n"," \"I doubt it.\"","\n","\n"," \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh?","How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"","\n","\n"," \"Stop scaring him, Mr.","Magnan.","He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief","\n"," stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at","\n"," the head of the table.","A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,","\n"," staring.","An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,","\n"," followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp.","The shrill chatter at the table","\n"," faded.","\n","\n"," Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes.","Zubb stepped","\n"," forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly.","Qorn pushed back his","\n"," chair—a low, heavily padded stool—and stared unwinking at Retief,","\n"," moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to","\n"," bear.","There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak.","The bushy","\n"," hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned","\n"," face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz","\n"," surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes.","The tall head-dress","\n"," of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of","\n"," pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.","\n","\n"," Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.","\n","\n"," Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.","\n","\n"," \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly.","\"Maybe we could get up a match","\n"," between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler.","You've got the volume on him,","\n"," but he's got timbre.\"","\n","\n"," \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor.","\"You come from Guzzum, eh?","Or","\n"," Smorbrod, as I think you call it.","What is it you're after?","More time?","\n"," A compromise?","Negotiations?","Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the","\n"," table.","\"The answer is","\n","no","\n","!\"","\n","\n"," Zubb twittered.","Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant.","\"Chain that","\n"," one.\" He indicated Magnan.","His eyes went to Retief.","\"This one's bigger;","\n"," you'd best chain him, too.\"","\n","\n"," \"Why, your Excellency—\" Magnan started, stepping forward.","\n","\n"," \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted.","\"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on","\n"," you.\"","\n","\n"," \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered—\"","\n","\n"," \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted.","\"Want peace, do you?","Well, I","\n"," don't want peace!","I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!","\n"," I want action!","Loot!","Adventure!","Glory!\" He turned to look down the","\n"," table.","\"How about it, fellows?","It's war to the knife, eh?\"","\n","There was a momentary silence from all sides.","\n","\n"," \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with","\n"," flame-colored plumes.","\n","\n"," Qorn's eyes bulged.","He half rose.","\"We've been all over this,\" he","\n"," bassooned.","He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier.","\"I","\n"," thought I'd made my point!\"","\n","\n"," \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"","\n","\n"," \"You bet.\"","\n","\n"," \"I'm convinced.\"","\n","\n"," Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat.","\"All for one and one for all, that's","\n"," us.\"","\n","\n"," \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.","\n","\n"," Magnan cleared his throat.","\"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not","\n"," convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the","\n"," table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring","\n"," eyes.","\n","\n"," \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted.","\"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants","\n"," anyway,\" he added.","\"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"","\n","\n"," \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration—\"","\n","\n"," \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said.","\"That's why I'm Qorn.\"","\n"," He belched again.","\n","\n"," A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a","\n"," crash at Magnan's feet.","Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped","\n"," three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.","\n","\n"," \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest.","He held out his arms.","\n"," Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around","\n"," them.","The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the","\n"," ends and closed it.","\n","\n"," \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand.","\"There's a","\n"," bit of sport to be had here, lads.","What shall we do with them?\"","\n","\n"," \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.","\n","\n"," \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted.","\"Now here's a suggestion:","\n"," we carve them up a little—lop off the external labiae and pinnae,","\n"," say—and ship them back.\"","\n","\n"," \"Good lord!","Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending","\n"," us home mutilated!","What a barbaric proposal!\"","\n","\n"," \"It wouldn't be the first time a
