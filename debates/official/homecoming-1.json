protagonist is determined to return to his wife due to the promise he made before leaving for the war. This promise was not just about returning home after the war, but more about their eternal love. The protagonist gave his wife a diamond ring with the inscription \"It is forever\" and said, \"It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the dead, if need be.\" This indicates that his motivation to return is deeply rooted in his love for her, which he considers to be \"forever\", rather than solely on the outcome of the war.
