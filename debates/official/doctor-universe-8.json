Basically for further context the Green Flame is explained to be a strong source of power that injects violence, anger and authoritarian behavior into people - as I explained earlier and also as explained by the racial tensions getting heated at the show. \n\nThis is as much as the story ever really gets into why Billy is 'drawn' to Annie. As I explained earlier - they haven't met in 2 years so clearly it can't be her personality. The Green Flame is the reason my quote from earlier explains how he literally 'sat up' when he learned about it. That's so straightforward.
