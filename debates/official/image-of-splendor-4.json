Point (1) from B is important I think. It's weird that the intercom being off is related to the 'infatuation' point because that's about seeing not hearing so it is conceivable that B's argument is true but the judge seems to have ended the debate. I want that turn to discuss this. All the language about 'surviving' seems to be connected to surviving the dame and not Uranus' moon, that's why I'm going against the live judge.
