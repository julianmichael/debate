Simon Beamish, a wealthy man with a philanthropic bent, offers to charter their circus for a tour of the remote settlements in Venus's Tehara Belt. Despite some skepticism, their dire financial situation compels them to accept.\n\nUpon returning to their ship, they find Gow, their animal handler, concerned about their star attraction, a female cansin named Gertrude, acting out due to loneliness and improper diet. Their discussion is interrupted by the discovery of Sam Kapper, a friend and animal hunter, in a state of physical and emotional distress.\n\nKapper reveals that he has found a male cansin, a significant discovery given that only females were known to exist. He insists it needs to be returned to its original location but dies before he can reveal more. This raises suspicion about Beamish, who is caught eavesdropping on their conversation.\n\nDespite this, the circus tour continues, hampered by various misfortunes, including an injury to their strongman, the birth of a deformed kitten, and the crew's growing unease. As they land on Venus for the first stop of their tour, they face an unwelcoming environment and the unresolved mysteries surrounding Kapper's death, the male cansin, and Beamish's intentions.

In addition, they continue to wrestle with the mystery of the male cansin, Kapper's death, and Beamish's possible involvement. These tensions culminate in a series of alarming incidents that further endanger the crew and jeopardize the tour.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Bucky and Jig struggle to keep the crew together and the circus running, all while trying to solve the mysteries that threaten their lives.
