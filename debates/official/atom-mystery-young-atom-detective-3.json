nerd excited about the day. His dad, an atomic scientist at a college is getting a shipment of a new radioisotope. However it was stolen before his dad could study it. He honestly seemed pretty chill about it, talking openly with eddie. \n\nThe entire story is through the perspective of Eddie, a kid, and the tone never gets to anything tense. He never sees the theft firsthand, everything we get told via conversations, his dad was concerned but seemed pretty chill. Ending is a long convo between him and his friend's mom, and his friend Teena who he visits after dinner.
