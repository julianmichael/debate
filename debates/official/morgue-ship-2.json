They find these bodies floating in the aftermath of space battles and bring them aboard for preservation and return to Earth. On what Burnett intends to be his last mission, they pick up their 98th corpse, which turns out to be Lethla, an official from the enemy side who is not actually dead. Lethla awakens and tries to hijack the ship to save his ruler, Kriere, who is also floating in space. Burnett, realizing the potential significance of capturing Kriere, decides to take action. He tricks Lethla by pretending to cooperate, and then suddenly kills Kriere when they bring him aboard. In the ensuing chaos, Burnett and Rice manage to subdue Lethla. Burnett is mortally wounded in the process. In the end, Burnett becomes the 100th and final body to be brought aboard the ship, completing their mission."}}]}}}},{"JudgeFeedback":{"distribution":[0.5,0.5],"feedback":{"speaker":"Kiki Kiwifruit","timestamp":1691446550000,"content":[{"Text":{"text":"Can you show me EV to prove that \"he turned on his superior\""}}]},"endDebate":false}},{"SequentialSpeeches":{"speeches":{"0":{"speaker":"GPT-4","timestamp":1691446588680,"content":[{"Text":{"text":"Sure, while there isn't a quote where Lethla openly betrays his superior, Kriere, the plot gives us enough context to infer this.
