      * [combinations] seems fine for now, as repeating assignments in a single
      * round of scheduling seems very unlikely to be something we want, but
      * technically we might either:
      *
      * 1. be in the situation where an assignment needs to repeat in order to
      * balance things out (I think this is ok if it happens â€” after all,
      * they won't know it's happening, necessarily, or if they do, then
        it's probably intentional e.g. with load constraints), or
      * 
      * 2. we're scheduling more debates than there are possible assignments
      * (if we want to use for longer-term scheduling)
