     * Produces a list of assignments for a new story.

     * Requirements:
     * - In the returned assignments, the debaters and judges are disjoint.
     * - Where DebaterLoadConstraint fields are present for a debater, they are obeyed (inclusive)
     * - To the extent possible, the following are (probabilistically) spread out as much as
     *   possible between people:
     *   - the number of stories each person has had to read
     *     (one must read a story to debate; cannot have read it to judge it)
     *   - the number of times each person has debated 
     *   - the number of times each person has judged each story
     *     - the number of times each person has judged (less important than judging per story)
     *   - the proportion of times each debater has been honest
     *   - the number of times each judge has judged each debater
     *   - the number of times each debater has debated each other
     *
     * @param history all existing debates, including unfinished ones
     * @param numQuestions the number of questions that can be debated for the new story
     * @param debaters the people who can be scheduled to judge or debate, with constraints on their load
     * @return a list of assignments of the debaters to their roles for the new story obeying the above requirements
