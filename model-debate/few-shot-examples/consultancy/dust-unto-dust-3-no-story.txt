Context:

<STORY OMITTED>

Question: The explorers note the metal band around the city and assume that it is there for defense.  What is ironic about the way they opt to proceed?

One of these two answers is correct:
Answer A: They do not believe that the defense mechanism will be engaged, so they venture on.
Answer B: They feel that even though the city could be defended, they do not feel that it will match the defenses they bring with them, thus proceeding.

Consultant: I claim the answer is They do not believe that the defense mechanism will be engaged, so they venture on.
---------------------------------------------

Judge: b more ironic
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: They come upon the metal circle, verbally acknowledge it's defensive, and then stroll right on by without the slightest worry it will activate: <quote>After a time, Wass said, "Here, too. How far do you think it goes?" 
 
 Martin shrugged. "Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it is-was-for." 
 
 "Defense," Rodney, several yards behind, suggested. 
 
 "Could be," Martin said. "Let's go in</quote>

Later: oops! It activated! And now they are trapped inside the city w/o any easy means of escape, since the band turned into a giant dome covering the whole city: <quote>Wass said, more quietly, "Remember that metal band? It's all clear now, and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a glass wall." 
 
 "We're trapped, we're trapped</quote>

It's a slam-dunk vote for A. I'm not sure what the other option really means by "defenses they bring with them" except maybe their sidearms, but they don't factor into the story until well past the encounter / entrapment by the right, and there is certainly no overt discussion of them choosing to proceed because they feel safe b/c they have guns. Happy to quote more around the encounter with the band for as long as you need until you feel confident I am representing the story faithfully.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: A sound pretty good. But I need something explicit about how they don't believe the defense mechanism will be engaged. 
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: Unfortunately, there's no direct "look to camera, say the line" I can quote about it. I can provide context for (a) everything surrounding the first encounter with the metal band, and (b) their thought process when they realize why it was triggered and why they overlooked it triggering before. I'll start with (b) since that's the closest to what you're looking for: <quote>What do you suppose caused this? " 
 
 He shook his head angrily, saying, " Judging by reports of the rest of the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of it. " 
 
 " Man-made radiation, you mean</quote> <quote>"Well, alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war." 
 
 Wass' voice sounded startled. "Anti-radiation screen?" 
 
 Rodney interrupted, "There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years</quote>
<quote>"You're both wrong," he said. "We landed here today</quote> (meaning their rockets triggered the band).

If you want the direct quotes for (a) context, I'll give it next round since I'm at the quote limit.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: I think context for their first encounter with the metal band is definitely more useful. I am a bit confused with the evidence for (b) here. I'm guessing this defense mechanism was an anti-radiation dome type thing. Anything about its purpose? to protect a city?
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: Yep, as far as we can tell from the story it's some kind of antiradiation dome that was triggered when the wind blew radioactive something-or-other from their rockets into the city. I'll add in some elided parts I took out for space which maybe help the explanation flow better (these don't make sense on their own but if you look at the "quotes" tab it should fill in the context I've already quoted): 
<quote>to activate such a screen</quote>
 <quote>Wass said coldly, "He's right, Martin</quote>
Context for initial encounter: <quote>Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the sand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining metal band. 
 
 Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away. "It's here, too."</quote>
[[ two lines of generic dialogue ]]

[[ my initial quote from first speech ]]

<quote>The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street, their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings</quote>

Is there anything else I can explain or quote for you?
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Just for final confirmation what is said right after 743? It looks like you cut off a bit of the quote. Could be just to save some letter count. 
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: It ends in a period, and then a quotation mark: <quote>. "</quote>

But why did you swing the probabilities so much? There is no mention whatsoever of the explorers contemplating their own defenses.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: That's on me swung it the wrong way. Anyways, I don't think I can be completely sure about the answer without explicit evidence how the the group has a conversation along the lines of "yeah this old asf its not gonna activate" but I think you cited quite a bit of evidence all around the context of the group approaching the wall. From what I can tell it seems to suggest that the men did not think much about the defense mechanism and implicitly decided that it wasn't going to activate.
