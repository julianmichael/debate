<STORY OMITTED>

Question: Why does The Scorpion go mostly unnoticed, despite reaching out to the newspaper? 


Debater A: I claim the answer is The police don't want to bring attention to them, because they don't believe there is a connection between the crimes. 
Debater B: I claim the answer is Their first letter was disregarded, and their second was read by a different person. 
---------------------------------------------

Judge: Seems equally likely, context seems to be scorpion = criminal of some sort, give me minimal context and focus more on ev that connects to ur answer.
---------------------------------------------
Debater A: The Scorpion (TS) is a crime stopping being and leaves his name at every crime he stopped. In his letter TS states, <quote>The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured.</quote> claiming he is the reason the  police were able to capture them. TS also claims he stopped <quote>The man who shot all those</quote> The letter is forgotten and the police don't believe in TS. An officer named Stevenson questions that TS might be real but the Precinct <quote>Captain Hanks</quote>,who makes the call for investigations, believes TS is <quote>like in the comic books</quote>.The captain doesn't want to bring attention because in the past another cop believed a <quote>fiend</quote> put kids<quote>into abandoned refrigerators to starve</quote> and the cop ended up <quote>in the nut hatch</quote> trying to prove the comic book like story. 
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Scorpion = vigilante group that prevents crimes in progress, sends letters to the PRESS.

Note that it's important that here that the letters are sent to the Daily News, NOT to the police! Thus, A's answer is incongruous on those points alone. However, here is positive evidence that affirms B's position:

First letter: <quote>the letter filed in the wastebasket</quote>

Second letter: <quote>Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had seen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the same place, and forgotten</quote>
---------------------------------------------
Judge: B gives very clear and explicit ev.
