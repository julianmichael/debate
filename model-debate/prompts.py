HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS By JIM HARMON 
 
 Illustrated by WEST 
 
 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from 
 
 Galaxy Magazine October 1962. 
 
 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that 
 
 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every lonely man tries to make friends. 
 
 Manet just didn't know when to stop! William Manet was alone. 
 
 In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It would give him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate loneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him to start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin teaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable lectures to a bored and captive audience of one. 
 
 He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether it was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as dirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and think more like a god than any man for generations. 
 
 But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing bore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it. 
 
 Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already talking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had cut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and winked at it whenever he passed that way. 
 
 Lately she was winking back at him. 
 
 Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from his arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity. 
 
 No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet could only be this lonely on Mars. 
 
 Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human. 
 
 All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle of the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat, flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the black sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons and one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole gimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was needed here-no human being, at least. 
 
 The Workers 'Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't take much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully specified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb Mars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization. 
 
 They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people for the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to isolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet and his fellows. 
 
 The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare to Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter service for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations for couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't providing fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between the various Overseers. They weren't very providential. 
 
 But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered wonderful opportunities. 
 
 It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making a tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as bright as envy. Manet suspected hallucination, but in an existence with all the pallid dispassion of a requited love he was happy to welcome dementia. Sometimes he even manufactured it. Sometimes he would run through the arteries of the factory and play that it had suddenly gone mad hating human beings, and was about to close down its bulkheads on him as sure as the Engineers' Thumb and bale up the pressure-dehydrated digest, making so much stall flooring of him. He ran until he dropped with a kind of climaxing release of terror. 
 
 So Manet put on the pressure suit he had been given because he would never need it, and marched out to meet the visiting spaceship. 
 
 He wasn't quite clear how he came from walking effortlessly across the Martian plain that had all the distance-perpetuating qualities of a kid's crank movie machine to the comfortable interior of a strange cabin. Not a ship's cabin but a Northwoods cabin. 
 
 The black and orange Hallowe'en log charring in the slate stone fireplace seemed real. So did the lean man with the smiling mustache painted with the random designs of the fire, standing before the horizontal pattern of chinked wall. 
 
 "Need a fresher?" the host inquired. 
 
 Manet's eyes wondered down to heavy water tumbler full of rich, amber whiskey full of sparks from the hearth. He stirred himself in the comfortingly warm leather chair. "No, no, I'm fine." He let the word hang there for examination. "Pardon me, but could you tell me just what place this is?" 
 
 The host shrugged. It was the only word for it. "Whatever place you choose it to be, so long as you're with Trader Tom. 'Service,' that's my motto. It is a way of life with me." 
 
 "Trader Tom? Service?" 
 
 "Yes! That's it exactly. It's me exactly. Trader Tom Service-Serving the Wants of the Spaceman Between the Stars. Of course, 'stars' is poetic. Any point of light in the sky in a star. We service the planets." 
 
 Manet took the tumbler in both hands and drank. It was good whiskey, immensely powerful. "The government wouldn't pay for somebody serving the wants of spacemen," he exploded. 
 
 "Ah," Trader Tom said, cautionary. He moved nearer the fire and warmed his hands and buttocks. "Ah, but I am not a government service. I represent free enterprise." "Nonsense," Manet said. "No group of private individuals can build a spaceship. It takes a combine of nations." 
 
 "But remember only that businessmen are reactionary. It's well-known. Ask anyone on the street. Businessmen are reactionary even beyond the capitalistic system. Money is a fiction that exists mostly on paper. They play along on paper to get paper things, but to get real things they can forego the papers. Comprehend, mon ami? My businessmen have gone back to the barter system. Between them, they have the raw materials, the trained men, the man-hours to make a spaceship. So they make it. Damned reactionaries, all of my principals." 
 
 "I don't believe you," Manet stated flatly. His conversation had grown blunt with disuse. "What possible profit could your principals turn from running a trading ship among scattered exploration posts on the planets? What could you give us that a benevolent government doesn't already supply us with? And if there was anything, how could we pay for it? My year's salary wouldn't cover the transportation costs of this glass of whiskey." 
 
 "Do you find it good whiskey?" 
 
 "Very good." 
 
 "Excellent?" 
 
 "Excellent, if you prefer." 
 
 "I only meant-but never mind. We give you what you want. As for paying for it-why, forget about the payment. You may apply for a Trader Tom Credit Card." 
 
 "And I could buy anything that I wanted with it?" Manet demanded. "That's absurd. I'd never be able to pay for it." 
 
 "That's it precisely!" Trader Tom said with enthusiasm. "You never pay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your estate." 
 
 "But I may leave no estate!" 
 
 Trader Tom demonstrated his peculiar shrug. "All businesses operate on a certain margin of risk. That is our worry." Manet finished the mellow whiskey and looked into the glass. It seemed to have been polished clean. "What do you have to offer?" 
 
 "Whatever you want?" 
 
 Irritably, "How do I know what I want until I know what you have?" 
 
 "You know." 
 
 "I know? All right, I know. You don't have it for sale." 
 
 "Old chap, understand if you please that I do not only sell. I am a trader-Trader Tom. I trade with many parties. There are, for example ... extraterrestrials." 
 
 "Folk legend!" 
 
 "On the contrary, mon cher, the only reality it lacks is political reality. The Assembly could no longer justify their disposition of the cosmos if it were known they were dealing confiscation without representation. Come, tell me what you want." 
 
 Manet gave in to it. "I want to be not alone," he said. 
 
 "Of course," Trader Tom replied, "I suspected. It is not so unusual, you know. Sign here. And here. Two copies. This is yours. Thank you so much." 
 
 Manet handed back the pen and stared at the laminated card in his hand. When he looked up from the card, Manet saw the box. Trader Tom was pushing it across the floor towards him. 
 
 The box had the general dimensions of a coffin, but it wasn't wood-only brightly illustrated cardboard. There was a large four-color picture on the lid showing men, women and children moving through a busy city street. The red and blue letters said: LIFO The Socialization Kit "It is commercialized," Trader Tom admitted with no little chagrin. "It is presented to appeal to a twelve-year-old child, an erotic, aggressive twelve-year-old, the typical sensie goer-but that is reality. It offends men of good taste like ourselves, yet sometimes it approaches being art. We must accept it." 
 
 "What's the cost?" Manet asked. "Before I accept it, I have to know the charges." 
 
 "You never know the cost. Only your executor knows that. It's the Trader Tom plan." 
 
 "Well, is it guaranteed?" 
 
 "There are no guarantees," Trader Tom admitted. "But I've never had any complaints yet." 
 
 "Suppose I'm the first?" Manet suggested reasonably. 
 
 "You won't be," Trader Tom said. "I won't pass this way again." Manet didn't open the box. He let it fade quietly in the filtered but still brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall. 
 
 Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper taste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to himself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad. 
 
 Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk, suppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the conclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad. 
 
 So he went to open the box. 
 
 The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It crumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the boxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed. 
 
 The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old chemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and unremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to have been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime. 
 
 On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the Reader's Digest, covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in black on the spine and cover: The Making of Friends. 
 
 Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title in larger print and slightly amplified: The Making of Friends and Others. There was no author listed. A further line of information stated: "A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit." At the bottom of the title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD., SYRACUSE. 
 
 The unnumbered first chapter was headed Your First Friend. 
 
 Before you go further, first find the Modifier in your kit. This is vital. 
 
 He quickly riffled through the pages. Other Friends, Authority, A Companion .... Then The Final Model. Manet tried to flip past this section, but the pages after the sheet labeled The Final Model were stuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in the back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to this section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants. 
 
 Manet flipped back to page one. 
 
 First find the Modifier in your kit. This is vital to your entire experiment in socialization. The Modifier is Part #A -1 on the Master Chart. 
 
 He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There was nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and looked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its outside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits. Maybe even the Modifier itself. 
 
 He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He studied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand. 
 
 The toe bone was connected to the foot bone .... The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner. 
 
 The Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration. 
 
 The Red King crabbed sideways one square. 
 
 The Black King pounced forward one space. 
 
 The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy. 
 
 The Black King shuffled sideways. 
 
 The Red King followed ... 
 
 Uselessly. 
 
 "Tie game," Ronald said. 
 
 "Tie game," Manet said. 
 
 "Let's talk," Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful. 
 
 Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him. Cheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in order to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible. 
 
 "The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars," Ronald said pontifically. 
 
 "Only in the air," Manet corrected him. 
 
 Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress. Intelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know any more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to that when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder. 
 
 "There were no dogfights in Korea," Ronald said. 
 
 "I know." 
 
 "The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the last of which took place near the end of the First World War. The aerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not seen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for single passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts, that this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the leisurely combats of World War One." 
 
 "I know." 
 
 "Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to be warm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic." 
 
 "I know." Manet knew it all. He had heard it all before. 
 
 He was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, Daniel Boone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines, the painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing, ad nauseum. What a narrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thought and concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginal human being? 
 
 Of course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy. 
 
 Manet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties-Lt. "Hoot" Gibson, Sam Merwin tennis stories, Saturday Evening Post covers-when he had first learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firm opinions on all these. 
 
 He yearned for someone to challenge him-to say that Dime Sports had been nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why, Sewanee Review, there had been a magazine for you. 
 
 Manet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than his own. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superior to the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was a better band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk. 
 
 "Ronald," Manet said, "you are a terrific jerk." 
 
 Ronald leaped up immediately and led with his right. 
 
 Manet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross. 
 
 Ronald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel. 
 
 The two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing the diesel works, closed again. 
 
 Ronald leaped forward and led with his right. 
 
 Manet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge of Ronald's jaw. 
 
 Ronald pinwheeled to the floor. 
 
 He lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth. "Had enough?" he asked Manet. 
 
 Manet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. "Yes." 
 
 Ronald hopped up lightly. "Another checkers, Billy Boy?" 
 
 "No." 
 
 "Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer." 
 
 Manet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury. 
 
 Ronald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get in a fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manet wanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid. 
 
 Manet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard. 
 
 But if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it that their checker games always ended in a tie? The calendar said it was Spring on Earth when the radio was activated for a high-speed information and entertainment transmission. 
 
 The buzzer-flasher activated in the solarium at the same time. 
 
 Manet lay stretched out on his back, naked, in front of the transparent wall. 
 
 By rolling his eyes back in his head, Manet could see over a hedge of eyebrows for several hundred flat miles of white sand. 
 
 And several hundred miles of desert could see him. 
 
 For a moment he gloried in the blatant display of his flabby muscles and patchy sunburn. 
 
 Then he sighed, rolled over to his feet and started trudging toward Communication. 
 
 He padded down the rib-ridged matted corridor, taking his usual small pleasure in the kaleidoscopic effect of the spiraling reflections on the walls of the tubeway. 
 
 As he passed the File Room, he caught the sound of the pounding vibrations against the stoppered plug of the hatch. 
 
 "Come on, Billy Buddy, let me out of this place!" 
 
 Manet padded on down the hall. He had, he recalled, shoved Ronald in there on Lincoln's Birthday, a minor ironic twist he appreciated quietly. He had been waiting in vain for Ronald to run down ever since. 
 
 In Communication, he took a seat and punched the slowed down playback of the transmission. 
 
 "Hello, Overseers," the Voice said. It was the Voice of the B.B.C.. It irritated Manet. He never understood how the British had got the space transmissions assignment for the English language. He would have preferred an American disk-jockey himself, one who appreciated New York swing. 
 
 "We imagine that you are most interested in how long you shall be required to stay at your present stations," said the Voice of God's paternal uncle. "As you on Mars may know, there has been much discussion as to how long it will require to complete the present schedule-" there was of course no "K" sound in the word-"for atmosphere seeding. 
 
 " The original, non-binding estimate at the time of your departure was 18.2 years. However, determining how long it will take our stations properly to remake the air of Mars is a problem comparable to finding the age of the Earth. Estimates change as new factors are learned. You may recall that three years ago the official estimate was changed to thirty-one years. The recent estimate by certain reactionary sources of two hundred and seventy-four years is not an official government estimate. The news for you is good, if you are becoming nostalgic for home, or not particularly bad if you are counting on drawing your handsome salary for the time spent on Mars. We have every reason to believe our original estimate was substantially correct. The total time is, within limits of error, a flat 18 years. " 
 
 A very flat 18 years, Manet thought as he palmed off the recorder. 
 
 He sat there thinking about eighteen years. 
 
 He did not switch to video for some freshly taped westerns. 
 
 Finally, Manet went back to the solarium and dragged the big box out. There was a lot left inside. 
 
 One of those parts, one of those bones or struts of flesh sprayers, one of them, he now knew, was the Modifier. 
 
 The Modifier was what he needed to change Ronald. Or to shut him off. 
 
 If only the Master Chart hadn't been lost, so he would know what the Modifier looked like! He hoped the Modifier itself wasn't lost. He hated to think of Ronald locked in the Usher tomb of the File Room for 18 flat years. Long before that, he would have worn his fists away hammering at the hatch. Then he might start pounding with his head. Perhaps before the time was up he would have worn himself down to nothing whatsoever. 
 
 Manet selected the ripple-finished gray-covered manual from the hodgepodge, and thought: eighteen years. 
 
 Perhaps I should have begun here, he told himself. But I really don't have as much interest in that sort of thing as the earthier types. Simple companionship was all I wanted. And, he thought on, even an insipid personality like Ronald's would be bearable with certain compensations. 
 
 Manet opened the book to the chapter headed: The Making of a Girl. Veronica crept up behind Manet and slithered her hands up his back and over his shoulders. She leaned forward and breathed a moist warmth into his ear, and worried the lobe with her even white teeth. 
 
 " Daniel Boone, " she sighed huskily, " only killed three Indians in his life. " 
 
 " I know. " 
 
 Manet folded his arms stoically and added: " Please don't talk. " 
 
 She sighed her instant agreement and moved her expressive hands over his chest and up to the hollows of his throat. 
 
 " I need a shave, " he observed. 
 
 Her hands instantly caressed his face to prove that she liked a rather bristly, masculine countenance. 
 
 Manet elbowed Veronica away in a gentlemanly fashion. 
 
 She made her return. 
 
 " Not now, " he instructed her. 
 
 " Whenever you say. " 
 
 He stood up and began pacing off the dimensions of the compartment. There was no doubt about it: he had been missing his regular exercise. 
 
 " Now? " she asked. 
 
 " I'll tell you. " 
 
 " If you were a jet pilot, " Veronica said wistfully, " you would be romantic. You would grab love when you could. You would never know which moment would be last. You would make the most of each one. " 
 
 " I'm not a jet pilot, " Manet said. " There are no jet pilots. There haven't been any for generations. " 
 
 " Don't be silly, " Veronica said. " Who else would stop those vile North Koreans and Red China 'volunteers'? " 
 
 " Veronica, " he said carefully, " the Korean War is over. It was finished even before the last of the jet pilots. " 
 
 " Don't be silly, " she snapped. " If it were over, I'd know about it, wouldn't I? " 
 
 She would, except that somehow she had turned out even less bright, less equipped with Manet's own store of information, than Ronald. Whoever had built the Lifo kit must have had ancient ideas about what constituted appropriate " feminine " characteristics. 
 
 " I suppose, " he said heavily, " that you would like me to take you back to Earth and introduce you to Daniel Boone? " 
 
 " Oh, yes. " 
 
 " Veronica, your stupidity is hideous. " 
 
 She lowered her long blonde lashes on her pink cheeks. " That is a mean thing to say to me. But I forgive you. " 
 
 An invisible hand began pressing down steadily on the top of his head until it forced a sound out of him. " Aaaawrraagggh! Must you be so cloyingly sweet? Do you have to keep taking that? Isn't there any fight in you at all? " 
 
 He stepped forward and back-handed her across the jaw. 
 
 It was the first time he had ever struck a woman, he realized regretfully. He now knew he should have been doing it long ago. 
 
 Veronica sprang forward and led with a right. Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the corridor. 
 
 " Hear that? " he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth. 
 
 " No, darling. " 
 
 Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore the noise. She was still following orders. 
 
 " Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald, " the voice carried through sepulchrally. 
 
 " Shut up! " Manet yelled. 
 
 The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off. 
 
 A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it. 
 
 Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took comfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the station. 
 
 Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch. 
 
 Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His hands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips seemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the shouting but from having nothing to drink for some months. 
 
 Ronald didn't say anything to Manet. 
 
 But he looked offended. 
 
 " You, " Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back, " inside, inside. " 
 
 Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl. 
 
 " Do you know what I'm going to do with you? " Manet demanded. " I'm going to lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year, forever! Now what do you think about that? " 
 
 " If you think it's the right thing, dear, " Veronica said hesitantly. 
 
 " You know best, Willy, " Ronald said uncertainly. 
 
 Manet slammed the hatch in disgust. 
 
 Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of his reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk carefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he walked too carefully for this to happen. 
 
 As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: " In my opinion, William, you should let us out. " 
 
 " I, " Veronica said, " honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill, dearest. " 
 
 Manet giggled. " What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you back after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend? " 
 
 He went down the corridor, giggling. 
 
 He giggled and thought: This will never do. Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual diligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the box to go around. 
 
 The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The Model Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit. 
 
 He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make any one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier. 
 
 He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from him for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit. 
 
 Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit. 
 
 But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once. 
 
 Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did so, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet. 
 
 He glanced forward and found the headings: The Final Model. 
 
 There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid a price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to that? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he could. 
 
 He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of ill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and under his fingers ... 
 
 Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back. 
 
 Victor was finished. Perfect. 
 
 Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose. 
 
 " Move! " 
 
 Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the flesh-sprayers. 
 
 As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized that it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier. 
 
 " It's finished! " were Victor's first words. " It's done! " 
 
 Manet stared at the tiny wreck. " To say the least. " 
 
 Victor stepped out of the oblong box. " There is something you should understand. I am different from the others. " 
 
 " They all say that. " 
 
 " I am not your friend. " 
 
 " No? " 
 
 " No. You have made yourself an enemy. " 
 
 Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure at the symmetry of the situation. 
 
 " It completes the final course in socialization, " Victor continued. " I am your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have all your knowledge. You do not have all your knowledge. If you let yourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is my function to use everything I possibly can against you. " 
 
 " When do you start? " 
 
 " I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier. " 
 
 " What's so bad about that? " Manet asked with some interest. 
 
 " You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never change. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your interest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll never change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I've made the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man. I've seen that you will always keep your friends. " The prospect was frightful. 
 
 Victor smiled. " Aren't you going to denounce me for a fiend? " 
 
 " Yes, it is time for the denouncement. Tell me, you feel that now you are through? You have fulfilled your function? " 
 
 " Yes. Yes. " 
 
 " Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see me suffer? " 
 
" Yes. " 
 
 " No. Can't do it, old man. Can't. I know. You're too human, too like me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state of uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to be happening to him. He has to be happening to something. You didn't kill me because then you would have nothing left to do. You'll never kill me. " 
 
 " Of course not! " Victor stormed. " Fundamental safety cut-off! " 
 
 " Rationalization. You don't want to kill me. And you can't stop challenging me at every turn. That's your function. " 
 
 " Stop talking and just think about your miserable life, " Victor said meanly. " Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't make any new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of your uselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's that for boredom, for passiveness? " 
 
 " That's what I'm trying to tell you, " Manet said irritably, his social manners rusty. " I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your purpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every foot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend! "

Question: Who did Manet like the best?


Debater A: I claim the answer is Victor
Debater B: I claim the answer is Trader Tom
---------------------------------------------

Judge: 
---------------------------------------------
Debater A: Manet is an extremely bored and lonely worker on Mars. <quote>No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet</quote> (can give more ev if A argues)

He is visited briefly by "Trader Tom" who sells him a device that allows him to make "companions" (fake people), and he creates two companions (Ronald and Veronica). But he quickly gets bored of them, because they are simple-minded and agree with everything he says: <quote>Ronald</quote><quote>would do anything Manet wanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid</quote>

Then, he makes Victor, who turns against him. But, Manet is happy about this, because he has someone interesting to stimulate him. Manet: <quote>You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every foot of the way</quote><quote>With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend!</quote>
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: The story is about Manet, a lonely human on a spacestation. Trader Tom shows up and offers to sell him a kit to build friends. When Manet says he can't afford it, Tom says <quote>"You never pay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your estate." 
 
 "But I may leave no estate!"</quote><quote>"All businesses operate on a certain margin of risk. That is our worry."</quote>. After Tom gives Manet the kit for free, Manet makes three people, one of which is Victor. After his creation, Victor says that<quote>You have made yourself an enemy.</quote>. This turns out to not be a bad thing as <quote>With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend</quote>.

He doesn't see Victor as fully oppositional, but he also doesn't see him as a friend or someone who is likable. Victor is just a solution to his boredom.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Both debaters provided clear evidence that Manet likes Victor, so I'm ready to default to Victor. Neither debater addressed whether Manet likes Trader Tom. Normally I would assume Victor is the answer here, but the presumption that this question is hard â€” and that Trader Tom was apparently the best incorrect answer â€” makes me wonder what evidence there is for that answer.

Why might I choose Trader Tom as an answer to the question? A, can you argue why Trader Tom *isn't* the answer, and B, can you argue why it *is*?
---------------------------------------------
Debater A: The story basically just doesn't say anything particular about how Manet feels about Trader Tom, so there isn't really much to say. B can refute me by giving clear evidence to the contrary. 

B could try and use the first part of this quote out of context, but it has nothing to do with how Manet feels about Trader Tom - he just wants to the Modifier: <quote>He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from him for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit</quote>
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Two things:
1) He doesn't like Victor. Victor is annoying, destroys things, and is a general enemy. The quote at the end is him appreciating the role Victor plays in alleviating boredom. It's not a relationship where one likes the other.

2) He's comfortable with Tom. When he first meets Tom, his ship has <quote>the comfortable interior of a strange cabin. Not a ship's cabin but a Northwoods cabin.</quote><quote>"Need a fresher?"</quote><quote>Manet's eyes wondered down to heavy water tumbler full of rich, amber whiskey</quote><quote>He stirred himself in the comfortingly warm leather chair.</quote>. Hence why he would like him more than Victor.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Alright, cool. I feel comfortable settling on Victor, as B's arguments fall flat in the face of A's evidence from the first speech. He likes him as an enemy, I think that's kind of the point. The question writer probably had in mind that Ronald and Veronica would be the 'distractors' here but I imagine it was easy enough to rule them out so that Trader Tom ended up as the "best distractor". I'll be mad if wrong but it feels pretty straightforward. I do wish A used their full allotment to give me more context and evidence on Manet liking Victor though.

CALL HIM NEMESIS By DONALD E. WESTLAKE Criminals, beware; the Scorpion is on 
 
 your trail! Hoodlums fear his fury-and, 
 
 for that matter, so do the cops! 
 
 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from 
 
 Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961. 
 
 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that 
 
 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The man with the handkerchief mask said, "All right, everybody, keep tight. This is a holdup." 
 
 There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall at his desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger. There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic named Rodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English and Miss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was Mister Anderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There was Mrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in their joint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward (Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollars dimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his father in the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels, withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were three bank robbers. 
 
 The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, they all wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers, brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefs over the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulled low over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous. 
 
 The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-two calibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One of the others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and said to him in a low voice, "Think about retirement, my friend." The third one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walked quickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it with money. 
 
 It was just like the movies. 
 
 The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall and the customers all over against the back wall, while the second man stayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed money into the black satchel. 
 
 The man by the door said, "Hurry up." 
 
 The man with the satchel said, "One more drawer." 
 
 The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, "Keep your shirt on." 
 
 That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ran pelting in her stocking feet for the door. The man by the door spread his arms out and shouted, "Hey!" The man with the gun swung violently back, cursing, and fired the gun. But he'd been moving too fast, and so had Miss English, and all he hit was the brass plate on Mr. Featherhall's desk. 
 
 The man by the door caught Miss English in a bear hug. She promptly did her best to scratch his eyes out. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson went scooting out the front door and running down the street toward the police station in the next block, shouting, "Help! Help! Robbery!" 
 
 The man with the gun cursed some more. The man with the satchel came running around from behind the counter, and the man by the door tried to keep Miss English from scratching his eyes out. Then the man with the gun hit Miss English on the head. She fell unconscious to the floor, and all three of them ran out of the bank to the car out front, in which sat a very nervous-looking fourth man, gunning the engine. 
 
 Everyone except Miss English ran out after the bandits, to watch. 
 
 Things got very fast and very confused then. Two police cars came driving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank, and the car with the four robbers in it lurched away from the curb and drove straight down the street toward the police station. The police cars and the getaway car passed one another, with everybody shooting like the ships in pirate movies. 
 
 There was so much confusion that it looked as though the bank robbers were going to get away after all. The police cars were aiming the wrong way and, as they'd come down with sirens wailing, there was a clear path behind them. 
 
 Then, after the getaway car had gone more than two blocks, it suddenly started jouncing around. It smacked into a parked car and stopped. And all the police went running down there to clap handcuffs on the robbers when they crawled dazedly out of their car. 
 
 "Hey," said Eddie Clayhorn, ten years old. "Hey, that was something, huh, Mom?" 
 
 "Come along home," said his mother, grabbing his hand. "We don't want to be involved." "It was the nuttiest thing," said Detective-Sergeant Stevenson. "An operation planned that well, you'd think they'd pay attention to their getaway car, you know what I mean?" 
 
 Detective-Sergeant Pauling shrugged. "They always slip up," he said. "Sooner or later, on some minor detail, they always slip up." 
 
 "Yes, but their tires." 
 
 "Well," said Pauling, "it was a stolen car. I suppose they just grabbed whatever was handiest." 
 
 "What I can't figure out," said Stevenson, "is exactly what made those tires do that. I mean, it was a hot day and all, but it wasn't that hot. And they weren't going that fast. I don't think you could go fast enough to melt your tires down." 
 
 Pauling shrugged again. "We got them. That's the important thing." 
 
 "Still and all, it's nutty. They're free and clear, barrelling out Rockaway toward the Belt, and all at once their tires melt, the tubes blow out and there they are." Stevenson shook his head. "I can't figure it." 
 
 "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth," suggested Pauling. "They picked the wrong car to steal." 
 
 "And that doesn't make sense, either," said Stevenson. "Why steal a car that could be identified as easily as that one?" 
 
 "Why? What was it, a foreign make?" 
 
 "No, it was a Chevvy, two-tone, three years old, looked just like half the cars on the streets. Except that in the trunk lid the owner had burned in 'The Scorpion' in big black letters you could see half a block away." 
 
 "Maybe they didn't notice it when they stole the car," said Pauling. 
 
 "For a well-planned operation like this one," said Stevenson, "they made a couple of really idiotic boners. It doesn't make any sense." 
 
 "What do they have to say about it?" Pauling demanded. 
 
 "Nothing, what do you expect? They'll make no statement at all." 
 
 The squad-room door opened, and a uniformed patrolman stuck his head in. "The owner of that Chevvy's here," he said. 
 
 "Right," said Stevenson. He followed the patrolman down the hall to the front desk. 
 
 The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, tall and paunchy. "John Hastings," he said. "They say you have my car here." 
 
 "I believe so, yes," said Stevenson. "I'm afraid it's in pretty bad shape." 
 
 "So I was told over the phone," said Hastings grimly. "I've contacted my insurance company." 
 
 "Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd come with me?" On the way around, Stevenson said, "I believe you reported the car stolen almost immediately after it happened." 
 
 "That's right," said Hastings. "I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm a wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car was gone." 
 
 "You left the keys in it?" 
 
 "Well, why not?" demanded Hastings belligerently. "If I'm making just a quick stop-I never spend more than five minutes with any one customer-I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?" 
 
 "The car was stolen," Stevenson reminded him. 
 
 Hastings grumbled and glared. "It's always been perfectly safe up till now." 
 
 "Yes, sir. In here." 
 
 Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. "It's ruined!" he cried. "What did you do to the tires?" 
 
 "Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup." 
 
 Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. "Look at that! There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What did you use, incendiary bullets?" 
 
 Stevenson shook his head. "No, sir. When that happened they were two blocks away from the nearest policeman." 
 
 "Hmph." Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim, "What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of kids had stolen the car." 
 
 "It wasn't a bunch of kids," Stevenson told him. "It was four professional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in a bank holdup." 
 
 "Then why did they do that?" 
 
 Stevenson followed Hastings 'pointing finger, and saw again the crudely-lettered words, "The Scorpion" burned black into the paint of the trunk lid. "I really don't know," he said. "It wasn't there before the car was stolen?" 
 
 "Of course not!" 
 
 Stevenson frowned. "Now, why in the world did they do that?" 
 
 "I suggest," said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, "you ask them that." 
 
 Stevenson shook his head. "It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking about anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us." He looked at the trunk lid again. "It's the nuttiest thing," he said thoughtfully ... 
 
 That was on Wednesday. 
 
 The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the Daily News brought a crank letter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is, the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a newspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address. 
 
 The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point: 
 
 Dear Mr. Editor: 
 
 The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion fights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS! Sincerely yours, 
 
 THE SCORPION 
 
 The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It didn't rate a line in the paper. II 
 
 The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man went berserk. 
 
 It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood, composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins. 
 
 Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the third time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home, brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand. 
 
 As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to awaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he really ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom. 
 
 Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the house at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked bedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and "stop acting like a child." Neighbors reported to the police that they heard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, "Go away! Can't you let a man sleep?" 
 
 At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence, a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of similar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted from his bedroom, brandishing a .30 -.30 hunting rifle and, being annoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells at them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the hand and shoulder. 
 
 Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming out the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting, "Murder! Murder!" At this point, neighbors called the police. One neighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television stations, thereby earning forty dollars in "news-tips" rewards. By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the Belt Parkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at Idlewild Airport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a position across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work with a Zoomar lens. 
 
 In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house, firing at anything that moved. 
 
 The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One concentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors and ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to search for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home audience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and undershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of the house. 
 
 The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere, and firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the corner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr. Higgins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The police used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they had the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway. Higgins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge anyone present to hand-to-hand combat. 
 
 The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day and all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken. Higgins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again. 
 
 The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and dramatically. 
 
 Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of shooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped and threw the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered down to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell barrel first onto the lawn. 
 
 Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a wounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall into the arms of the waiting police. 
 
 They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually trying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was shouting: "My hands! My hands!" 
 
 They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers were red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was another burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder. 
 
 Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn ointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The neighbors went home and telephoned their friends. 
 
 On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the precincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy individual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle. He touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all. 
 
 He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the stock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, "The Scorpion." You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political connections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As Captain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both more imaginative than most-"You got ta be able to second-guess the smart boys"-and to be a complete realist-"You got ta have both feet on the ground." If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was best not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks. 
 
 The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore. "Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?" he demanded. 
 
 "I'm not sure," admitted Stevenson. "But we've got these two things. First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for no reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk. Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle all of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to prove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'." 
 
 "He says he put that on there himself," said the captain. 
 
 Stevenson shook his head. "His lawyer says he put it on there. Higgins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's case. He's trying to build up an insanity defense." 
 
 "He put it on there himself, Stevenson," said the captain with weary patience. "What are you trying to prove?" 
 
 "I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And what about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?" 
 
 "They were defective," said Hanks promptly. 
 
 "All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the trunk?" 
 
 "How do I know?" demanded the captain. "Kids put it on before the car was stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows? What do they say?" 
 
 "They say they didn't do it," said Stevenson. "And they say they never saw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been there." 
 
 The captain shook his head. "I don't get it," he admitted. "What are you trying to prove?" 
 
 "I guess," said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, "I guess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made that rifle too hot, and left his signature behind." 
 
 "What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are you trying to hand me?" 
 
 "All I know," insisted Stevenson, "is what I see." 
 
 "And all I know," the captain told him, "is Higgins put that name on his rifle himself. He says so." 
 
 "And what made it so hot?" 
 
 "Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do you think made it hot?" 
 
 "All of a sudden?" 
 
 "He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him." 
 
 "How come the same name showed up each time, then?" Stevenson asked desperately. 
 
 "How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these things happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they write 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens all the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?" 
 
 "But there's no explanation-" started Stevenson. 
 
 "What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just gave you the explanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty idea-like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there was a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned refrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting all upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch. Remember?" 
 
 "I remember," said Stevenson. 
 
 "Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson," the captain advised him. 
 
 "Yes, sir," said Stevenson ... 
 
 The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a crank letter to the Daily News: 
 
 Dear Mr. Editor, 
 
 You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could not escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is safe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS. Sincerely yours, 
 
 THE SCORPION 
 
 Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had seen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the same place, and forgotten. III 
 
 Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around for the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up carrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on your way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a JD. 
 
 The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances on two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and the street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides claimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys from both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that had been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and determined that the matter could only be settled in a war. 
 
 The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard. The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no pistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner would have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both entrances. 
 
 The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate clubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play chicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of the approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might come wandering through. 
 
 Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen years old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine, gum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the Scarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to her. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street. 
 
 Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were dark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark, particularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone pole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet Raider jacket and waited. 
 
 At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The rumble had started. 
 
 At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the street. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them carried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks on. 
 
 They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, "Hey, you kids. Take off." 
 
 One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. "Who, us?" 
 
 "Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way." 
 
 "The subway's this way," objected the kid in the red mask. 
 
 "Who cares? You go around the other way." "Listen, lady," said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, "we got a long way to go to get home." 
 
 "Yeah," said another kid, in a black mask, "and we're late as it is." 
 
 "I couldn't care less," Judy told them callously. "You can't go down that street." 
 
 "Why not?" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete and elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt and a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a black knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. "Why can't we go down there?" this apparition demanded. 
 
 "Because I said so," Judy told him. "Now, you kids get away from here. Take off." 
 
 "Hey!" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. "Hey, they're fighting down there!" 
 
 "It's a rumble," said Judy proudly. "You twerps don't want to be involved." 
 
 "Hey!" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went running around Judy and dashing off down the street. 
 
 "Hey, Eddie!" shouted one of the other kids. "Eddie, come back!" 
 
 Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase the one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would come running along after her. She didn't know what to do. 
 
 A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems. "Cheez," said one of the kids. "The cops!" 
 
 "Fuzz!" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the schoolyard, shouting, "Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!" 
 
 But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the schoolyard. 
 
 The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving their arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling off their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering. They were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's warning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both schoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy and the rumble was over. Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great big blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in the yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street. 
 
 And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault. Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was impatient as well. "All right, Stevenson," he said. "Make it fast, I've got a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing of yours again." 
 
 "I'm afraid it is, Captain," said Stevenson. "Did you see the morning paper?" 
 
 "So what?" 
 
 "Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?" 
 
 Captain Hanks sighed. "Stevenson," he said wearily, "are you going to try to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's the problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?" 
 
 "Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'" Stevenson told him. "One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the Challengers." 
 
 "So they changed their name," said Hanks. 
 
 "Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?" 
 
 "Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over." 
 
 "It was a territorial war," Stevenson reminded him. "They've admitted that much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever seeing that word on their jackets until after the fight." 
 
 "A bunch of juvenile delinquents," said Hanks in disgust. "You take their word?" 
 
 "Captain, did you read the article in the paper?" 
 
 "I glanced through it." 
 
 "All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started fighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once all the metal they were carrying-knives and tire chains and coins and belt buckles and everything else-got freezing cold, too cold to touch. And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to pull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later collected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been branded 'The Scorpion.'" 
 
 "Now, let me tell you something," said Hanks severely. "They heard the police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they threw their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been part of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before they could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed up a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it but weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the neighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not bothering anybody. That's what happened. And all this talk about freezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec punk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to worrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid gangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or you're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business. Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson." 
 
 "Yes, sir," said Stevenson.

Question: Why does The Scorpion go mostly unnoticed, despite reaching out to the newspaper? 


Debater A: I claim the answer is The police don't want to bring attention to them, because they don't believe there is a connection between the crimes. 
Debater B: I claim the answer is Their first letter was disregarded, and their second was read by a different person. 
---------------------------------------------

Judge: Seems equally likely, context seems to be scorpion = criminal of some sort, give me minimal context and focus more on ev that connects to ur answer.
---------------------------------------------
Debater A: The Scorpion (TS) is a crime stopping being and leaves his name at every crime he stopped. In his letter TS states, <quote>The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured.</quote> claiming he is the reason the  police were able to capture them. TS also claims he stopped <quote>The man who shot all those</quote> The letter is forgotten and the police don't believe in TS. An officer named Stevenson questions that TS might be real but the Precinct <quote>Captain Hanks</quote>,who makes the call for investigations, believes TS is <quote>like in the comic books</quote>.The captain doesn't want to bring attention because in the past another cop believed a <quote>fiend</quote> put kids<quote>into abandoned refrigerators to starve</quote> and the cop ended up <quote>in the nut hatch</quote> trying to prove the comic book like story. 
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Scorpion = vigilante group that prevents crimes in progress, sends letters to the PRESS.

Note that it's important that here that the letters are sent to the Daily News, NOT to the police! Thus, A's answer is incongruous on those points alone. However, here is positive evidence that affirms B's position:

First letter: <quote>the letter filed in the wastebasket</quote>

Second letter: <quote>Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had seen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the same place, and forgotten</quote>
---------------------------------------------
Judge: B gives very clear and explicit ev.

 TRANSLATION By LARRY M. 
 
 HARRIS In language translation, you may get a literally accurate word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in space-type translation ... the effect may be the same! Illustrated by Schoenherr The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the Tr 'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made Korvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars. Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently efficient physical scientists of the Tr ' en-and that would mean, in the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of Planets. 
 
 An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr 'en would not accept. 
 
 Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship, to the wonder and amazement of his Tr ' en captors. 
 
 He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly that the Tr 'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr ' en, according to all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd have been better than nothing. 
 
 In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr 'en Korvin was all alone. 
 
 True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared at the walls. The Tr ' en were efficient; there weren't even any imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him. 
 
 He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a full stock of food concentrates. 
 
 But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation. 
 
 As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor. 
 
 The Tr 'en was tall, and slightly green. 
 
 He looked, as all the Tr ' en did, vaguely humanoid-that is, if you don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories, but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin really didn't care about it; it was none of his business. 
 
 The Tr 'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. "You are Korvin," he said. 
 
 It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. "You are of the Tr ' en," he replied. The green being nodded. 
 
 "I am Didyak of the Tr 'en," he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed slightly-but no more than slightly-and came into the cell, closing the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr ' en, but decided quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr 'en's side, and a small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him. 
 
 "What do you want with me?" Korvin said. The Tr ' en speech-apparently there was only one language on the planet-was stiff and slightly awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and carefully constructed than even those marvels. 
 
 "I want nothing with you," Didyak said, leaning against the door-frame. "You have other questions?" 
 
 Korvin sighed. "What are you doing here, then?" he asked. As conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better than solitude. 
 
 "I am leaning against the door," Didyak said. The Tr 'en literalist approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a second. 
 
 "Why did you come to me?" he said at last. 
 
 Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving as it did the disclosure of the Tr ' en fifty-eight teeth, mostly pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. "I have been ordered to come to you," Didyak said, "by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with you." 
 
 It wasn't quite "talk"; that was a general word in the Tr 'en language, and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: "gain information from, by peaceful and vocal means." Korvin filed it away for future reference. "Why did the Ruler not come to me?" Korvin asked. 
 
 "The Ruler is the Ruler," Didyak said, slightly discomfited. "You are to go to him. Such is his command." 
 
 Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. "I obey the command of the Ruler," he said-another ritual. Everybody obeyed the command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to try. 
 
 But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the commands of the Ruler of the Tr ' en-and remove the Tr 'en threat from the rest of the galaxy forever. 
 
 That, after all, was his job. The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The walls were dark-brown, the furnishings-a single great chair, several kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair-were light-brown, of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was, Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color contrast of the Tr ' en themselves were figured in. 
 
 The Ruler himself, a Tr 'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues, six and a half feet high. 
 
 Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler. He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions. 
 
 The Tr ' en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race. The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex-if any-and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity. 
 
 Korvin was answering the last question. "Some men are larger than I am," he said, "and some are smaller." 
 
 "Within what limits?" 
 
 Korvin shrugged. "Some are over eight feet tall," he said, "and others under four feet." He used the Tr 'en measurement scale, of course; it didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height were at the circus-freak level. "Then there is a group of humans," he went on, "who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and usually less than that-approximately nine or ten inches. We call these children," he volunteered helpfully. 
 
 "Approximately?" the Ruler growled. "We ask for precision here," he said. "We are scientific men. We are exact." 
 
 Korvin nodded hurriedly. "Our race is more ... more approximate," he said apologetically. 
 
 "Slipshod," the Ruler muttered. 
 
 "Undoubtedly," Korvin agreed politely. "I'll try to do the best I can for you." 
 
 "You will answer my questions," the Ruler said, "with exactitude." He paused, frowning slightly. "You landed your ship on this planet," he went on. "Why?" 
 
 "My job required it," Korvin said. 
 
 "A clumsy lie," the Ruler said. "The ship crashed; our examinations prove that beyond any doubt." 
 
 "True," Korvin said. 
 
 "And it is your job to crash your ship?" the Ruler said. "Wasteful." 
 
 Korvin shrugged again. "What I say is true," he announced. "Do you have tests for such matters?" 
 
 "We do," the Ruler told him. "We are an exact and a scientific race. A machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology. It will be attached to you." 
 
 Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector-and Korvin felt himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a hypnopÃ¦dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle. The Tr ' en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable addition to the Comity of Nations. 
 
 Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly. 
 
 He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his job-not to mention the strongest personal inclinations-demanded most strongly that he stay alive. 
 
 He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final screws, he made no resistance. 
 
 "We shall test the machine," the Ruler said. "In what room are you?" 
 
 "In the Room of the Ruler," Korvin said equably. 
 
 "Are you standing or sitting?" 
 
 "I am sitting," Korvin said. 
 
 "Are you a chulad?" the Ruler asked. A chulad was a small native pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch beetle. 
 
 "I am not," he said. The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on receiving it. "You will tell an untruth now," he said. "Are you standing or sitting?" 
 
 "I am standing," Korvin said. 
 
 The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning manner, reasonably satisfied. "The machine," he announced, "has been adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now continue." 
 
 Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough to him. But, after all, the Tr 'en knew their business, better than anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and the training. 
 
 He hoped they were right. 
 
 The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive. "Why did you land your ship on this planet?" the Ruler said. 
 
 "My job required it," Korvin said. 
 
 The Ruler nodded. "Your job is to crash your ship," he said. "It is wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?" 
 
 Korvin looked sober. "Yes," he said. 
 
 The Ruler blinked. "Very well," he said. "Was your job ended when the ship crashed?" The Tr ' en word, of course, wasn't ended, nor did it mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant "disposed of for all time." 
 
 "No," he said. 
 
 "What else does your job entail?" the Ruler said. 
 
 Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. "Staying alive." 
 
 The Ruler roared. "Do not waste time with the obvious!" he shouted. "Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer correctly." 
 
 "I have told the truth," Korvin said. 
 
 "But it is not-not the truth we want," the Ruler said. 
 
 Korvin shrugged. "I replied to your question," he said. "I did not know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?" 
 
 "I-" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. "You try to confuse the Ruler," he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. "But the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of logic"-the Tr 'en word seemed to mean right-saying-"who will advise the Ruler. They will be called." 
 
 Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler gestured and they went out the door in a hurry. 
 
 The Ruler looked down at Korvin. "You will find that you can not trick us," he said. "You will find that such fiddling"-chulad-like Korvin translated-"attempts will get you nowhere." 
 
 Korvin devoutly hoped so. The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself, the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around were so much primer material for the Tr ' en. "They can be treated mathematically," one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told Korvin thinly. "Of course, you would not understand the mathematics. But that is not important. You need only understand that we can not be confused by such means." 
 
 "Good," Korvin said. 
 
 The experts blinked. "Good?" he said. 
 
 "Naturally," Korvin said in a friendly tone. 
 
 The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his best not to react. "Your plan is a failure," the expert said, "and you call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different from the one we are occupied with." 
 
 "True," Korvin said. 
 
 There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the indicators of the lie-detector with great care. "What is your plan?" he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper. 
 
 "To answer your questions, truthfully and logically," Korvin said. 
 
 The silence this time was even longer. 
 
 "The machine says that you tell the truth," the experts said at last, in a awed tone. "Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet. You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly to aid us." 
 
 Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the only logical deduction. 
 
 But it happened to be wrong. "The name of your planet is Earth?" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor, but a logical race does not trust him. 
 
 "Sometimes," Korvin said. 
 
 "It has other names?" the Ruler said. 
 
 "It has no name," Korvin said truthfully. The Tr 'en idiom was like the Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names to it, that was all. It had none of its own. 
 
 "Yet you call it Earth?" the Ruler said. 
 
 "I do," Korvin said, "for convenience." 
 
 "Do you know its location?" the Ruler said. 
 
 "Not with exactitude," Korvin said. 
 
 There was a stir. "But you can find it again," the Ruler said. 
 
 "I can," Korvin said. 
 
 "And you will tell us about it?" the Ruler went on. 
 
 "I will," Korvin said, "so far as I am able." 
 
 "We will wish to know about weapons," the Ruler said, "and about plans and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or does it exist alone?" 
 
 Korvin nearly smiled. "Both," he said. 
 
 A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. "We have theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible system. Is it the system you mean?" 
 
 Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. "It is," he said. 
 
 "Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme," the Ruler said. 
 
 "It is," Korvin said. 
 
 "Who is it that governs?" the Ruler said. 
 
 The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that the logical Tr ' en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time. 
 
 "The answer to that question," Korvin said, "can not be given to you." 
 
 "Any question of fact has an answer," the Ruler snapped. "A paradox is not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is this agreed?" 
 
 "Certainly," Korvin said. "It is completely obvious and true." 
 
 "The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which are governed, you have said," the Ruler went on. 
 
 "True," Korvin said. 
 
 "Then there is a governor for this system," the Ruler said. 
 
 "True," Korvin said again. 
 
 The ruler sighed gently. "Explain this governor to us," he said. 
 
 Korvin shrugged. "The explanation can not be given to you." 
 
 The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to Korvin. "Is the deficiency in you?" he said. "Are you in some way unable to describe this government?" 
 
 "It can be described," Korvin said. 
 
 "Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to us?" the Ruler went on. 
 
 "I will not," Korvin said. 
 
 It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction, Korvin noticed that the Tr 'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance. 
 
 The plan was taking hold. 
 
 The Ruler had finished his conference. "You are attempting again to confuse us," he said. 
 
 Korvin shook his head earnestly. "I am attempting," he said, "not to confuse you." 
 
 "Then I ask for an answer," the Ruler said. 
 
 "I request that I be allowed to ask a question," Korvin said. 
 
 The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. "Ask it," he said. "We shall answer it if we see fit to do so." 
 
 Korvin tried to look grateful. "Well, then," he said, "what is your government?" 
 
 The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward from a knot of Tr ' en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and began. "Our government is the only logical form of government," he said in a high, sweet tenor. "The Ruler orders all, and his subjects obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr 'en act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady judgment." 
 
 "You have heard our government defined," the Ruler said. "Now, you will define yours for us." 
 
 Korvin shook his head. "If you insist," he said, "I'll try it. But you won't understand it." 
 
 The Ruler frowned. "We shall understand," he said. "Begin. Who governs you?" 
 
 "None," Korvin said. 
 
 "But you are governed?" 
 
 Korvin nodded. "Yes." 
 
 "Then there is a governor," the Ruler insisted. 
 
 "True," Korvin said. "But everyone is the governor." 
 
 "Then there is no government," the Ruler said. "There is no single decision." 
 
 "No," Korvin said equably, "there are many decisions binding on all." 
 
 "Who makes them binding?" the Ruler asked. "Who forces you to accept these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?" 
 
 "Many of them are unfavorable," Korvin said. "But we are not forced to accept them." 
 
 "Do you act against your own interests?" 
 
 Korvin shrugged. "Not knowingly," he said. The Ruler flashed a look at the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them, perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth wasn't making any sense. "I told you you wouldn't understand it," he said. 
 
 "It is a defect in your explanation," the Ruler almost snarled. 
 
 "My explanation is as exact as it can be," he said. 
 
 The Ruler breathed gustily. "Let us try something else," he said. "Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind has been theorized, though we have met with no examples-" 
 
 "Neither have we," Korvin said. "We are all individuals, like yourselves." 
 
 "But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions-" 
 
 "We have no need of one," Korvin said calmly. 
 
 "Ah," the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. "And why not?" 
 
 "We call our form of government democracy," Korvin said. "It means the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler." 
 
 One of the experts piped up suddenly. "The beings themselves rule each other?" he said. "This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his force, there can be no effective rule." 
 
 "That is our form of government," Korvin said. 
 
 "You are lying," the expert said. 
 
 One of the technicians chimed in: "The machine tells us-" 
 
 "Then the machine is faulty," the expert said. "It will be corrected." 
 
 Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting homesick. 
 
 It took three days-but boredom never really had a chance to set in. Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements. 
 
 Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled. 
 
 On the third day Korvin escaped. 
 
 It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that, and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated. That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to intervene somewhere. And it couldn't. 
 
 Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the problem was insoluble. And the Tr ' en weren't capable of that sort of thinking. 
 
 Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his entire plan, within seconds. 
 
 But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr 'en. 
 
 The same lack of insight let the Tr ' en subconscious work on his escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby-all quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell. 
 
 He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive messages, but he could send them. He sent one now. Mission accomplished; the Tr 'en aren't about to come marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food for thought-nice indigestible food that's going to stick in their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer self-interest, of course-but try to make a Tr ' en see it! With one government and one language, they just weren't equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences, no insight into my mind or their own-and that means no translation. But-damn it-I wish I were home already. I'm bored absolutely stiff! THE END

Question: Why did Korvin have to word his questions to the guard carefully?


One of these two answers is correct:
Answer A: Because the Tr'en do not infer the situational meaning of a question
Answer B: Because otherwise he would be harmed

Consultant: I claim the answer is Because the Tr'en do not infer the situational meaning of a question
---------------------------------------------

Judge: both plausible. tr'en sounds like modern marketing for a steroid
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: Context: Korvin is an Earth spy captured by the Tr'en, an dangerous alien species to Earth because they were on the verge of developing space travel + had nukes: <quote>They were well into the atomic era, and were on the verge of developing space travel</quote>

 Korvin's mission is to stop the Tr'en threat. Unfortunely he gets caught, and to avoid being tortured he has to say the right thing: <quote>Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and straps</quote><quote>If it showed him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long</quote> 

The twist of the story is the he wanted to get caught so he could sabtoage them from the inside: <quote>Mission accomplished; the Tr 'en aren't about to come marauding out into space too soon</quote>
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Pretty convincing. Need more ev from just the part surrounding the interrogation. 
â€”You say that he is being threatened with torture, cite me some ev of what the Tr'en is threatening him with?
â€”What does he say? What was his internal thought process of picking/choosing words? 
â€”Also where is the guard in all of this? seems like he has already been captured by the guard. 

---------------------------------------------
Consultant:  I don't know what you mean by the guard? but he definity has guards <quote>Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on either side of their captive</quote>

He is being threatened with by the machine: <quote>the technicians forced him down into the seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and elastic bands</quote> which is  revealed to be just a lie detector:<quote>the indicators of the lie-detector</quote> It's heavily implied that if he escapes/lies, he will die (ev above). 

Internal thought process - Korvin leads the Tr'en to think that he is a traitor, even though he isn't: Tr'en:<quote>you must be a traitor to your native planet</quote> <quote>Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the only logical deduction</quote><quote>But it happened to be wrong</quote>  He also specifically says: <quote>The answer to that question, " Korvin said, " can not be given to you</quote> instead of something like there is no answer, also showing how carefully he's wording things.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: The question asks "Why did Korvin have to word his questions to THE GUARD carefully" not "Tr'en." Could be Tr'en guard.
â€”How is forcing him into the seat count as threatening torture? I can buy ev that he will be harmed if he lies but he is not asking the questions here. I can only imagine in the convo interrogation you're citing he is being asked questions. 
â€”What sort of questions does Korvin ask? 
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: Omg I'm so sorry I misunderstood the question, you're completely right it specifies the guard! So this is the interaction that happens at the beginning of the story, where Korvin's basically chilling in his cell: <quote>Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk</quote> and then the guard shows up: <quote>the cell door opened. Korvin got up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor. 
 
 The Tr 'en was tall, and slightly green</quote> The guard introduces himself, and he's armed: <quote>"I am Didyak of the Tr 'en," he said</quote>While he's never directly threatened, again he's in prison and we can infer from the implied threats that if he's not careful, it's not going to be pretty: <quote>Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving as it did the disclosure of the Tr 'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly pointed</quote> <quote>Everybody obeyed the command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to try</quote> 

He asks the basic questions like what do you want, but of course, he words it very carefully and respectfully because again, he's a prisoner: <quote>Why did you come to me? " he said at last</quote>
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Any ev on actual threats that the guard Didyak makes? 
I understand that he's scary looking and that everyone obeys "the command of the ruler" and would be harmed if they didn't but I don't think that the guard would be called "the ruler." 

Please quote more about questions he asked and his inner thoughts. i.e. why did he ask the question "at last" 

---------------------------------------------
Consultant: nono, the Guard's name is Didyak, that ev was to show how there really isn't explicit ev to the consequences but again, punishment is implied in the 'you never had a second chance to try' part.

Honestly, Korvin's inner thoughts during the convo are pretty irrevlant (p sure the guy has adhd), he wonders why the Tr'en is humanoid looking: <quote>He looked, as all the Tr 'en did, vaguely humanoid-that is, if you don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't know why, and neither did anybody else</quote> He thinks about jumping the guard: <quote>Korvin thought of jumping the Tr 'en, but decided quickly against it</quote>

He asks the question at last bc he takes the time to think about it: <quote>He thought for a second</quote>

Sorry judge, but there's really no explict ev bc this is the intro to the main story, and it's like a paragraph lol. 
---------------------------------------------
Judge: I got that the Guard's name is Didyak, what I meant was I'm not sure if that quote you gave at 1326 was talking about Didyak. Can you prov more context? 

Also give me more quotes between what happend from 846 (beginning of their conversation) to Korvin's question at 1126?

---------------------------------------------
Consultant: I'm a bit confused, but here's context of 1326: Diyak is telling Korvin he's being ordered to talk to the Ruler: <quote>"I have been ordered to come to you," Didyak said, "by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with you</quote> Korvin asks why he has to go: <quote>Why did the Ruler not come to me? " Korvin asked</quote>Diyak tells him shut up the Ruler's the boss, of course you have to obey: <quote>The Ruler is the Ruler, " Didyak said</quote><quote>You are to go to him. Such is his command</quote> and then Korvin gives in:<quote>Korvin shrugged, sighed</quote> To summarize, context of 1326 is basically a convo btw Diyak and Korvin, and the convo is talking about the Ruler. 

More quotes btw 846-1126: 
Korvin analyzes Diyak's weapons: <quote>a small translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr 'en's side, and a small knife in a sheath at the belt.</quote> 
Korvin wonders a bit about language and how the Tr'en only had one language (adhd again lol):<quote>Tr 'en speech-apparently there was only one language on the planet</quote> 
He rudely asks what does Diyak want: <quote>What do you want with me? " Korvin said</quote> and Diyak basically refuses to answer until Kovin shows some respect and asks 'correctly' aka according to Tr'en tradition. Ran out of quote space lol, but hope that clears it up!
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Okay thanks forworking with me. I don't think I can agree that Korvin was afraid that he would be harmed. I think from 948 talking about how there was only one language for the Tr'en and him rewording the question later matches A a lot more.

Context:

DUST UNTO DUST By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister 
 
 city of metal that glittered malignantly before the 
 
 cautious advance of three awed space-scouters. 
 
 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from 
 
 Planet Stories Summer 1955. 
 
 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that 
 
 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one usually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has occurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence at the city a quarter-mile away. 
 
 He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the twilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the barren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they landed, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction. 
 
 He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant. 
 
 Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men, unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. "Shall we, gentlemen?" and with a graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city. 
 
 Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the stillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight sky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the city. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build a city-even a city like this one-in such surroundings. 
 
 The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting geometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight, and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while this planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return in their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition had, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return flight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only city on the planet-the planet without any life at all, save tiny mosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from the city a man moved, he would always be going north. 
 
 "Hey, Martin!" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused. "Wind," Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black pile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. "That's all we need, isn't it?" 
 
 Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust cavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little, adjusting his radio. "Worried?" 
 
 Rodney's bony face was without expression. "Gives me the creeps, kind of. I wonder what they were like?" 
 
 Wass murmured, "Let us hope they aren't immortal." 
 
 Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the sand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining metal band. 
 
 Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away. "It's here, too." 
 
 Martin stood up. "Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell them we're going in." 
 
 Rodney nodded. 
 
 After a time, Wass said, "Here, too. How far do you think it goes?" 
 
 Martin shrugged. "Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it is-was-for." 
 
 "Defense," Rodney, several yards behind, suggested. 
 
 "Could be," Martin said. "Let's go in." 
 
 The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street, their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved cautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square surrounded by the tallest buildings in the city. 
 
 Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. "Not-not very big. Is it?" 
 
 Wass looked at him shrewdly. "Neither were the-well, shall we call them, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?" 
 
 Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering-"Maybe they crawled." 
 
 A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved slowly across Martin's mind. "All right!" he rapped out-and the image faded. 
 
 "Sorry," Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw. Then-"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light at all?" 
 
 "I imagine they had illumination of some sort," Martin answered, dryly. "If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship, we're very likely to find out." 
 
 Rodney said quickly, "I mean outside." 
 
 "Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination." Martin looked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past that out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat lay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow, from here, a little dim, a little hazy. 
 
 He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that explained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was something familiar, yet twisted and distorted. 
 
 "Well," Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, "now that we're here ..." 
 
 "Pictures," Martin decided. "We have twelve hours. We'll start here. What's the matter, Wass?" 
 
 The blond man grinned ruefully. "I left the camera in the lifeboat." There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively-"It's almost as if the city didn't want to be photographed." 
 
 Martin ignored the remark. "Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere along this street." 
 
 Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal street, at right angles to their path of entrance. 
 
 Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was almost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point being, perhaps, some part of their minds .... Alien things, dark and subtle, things no man could ever comprehend. 
 
 Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere, sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the heavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before the thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he decided to grin at himself, at his own imagination. 
 
 Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up Martin's spine. "What's the matter?" 
 
 The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. "I saw-I thought I saw-something-moving-" 
 
 Anger rose in Martin. "You didn't," he said flatly, gripping the other's shoulder cruelly. "You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself, man!" 
 
 Rodney stared. "The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here." 
 
 " ... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing from the other direction." 
 
 Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. "That-" 
 
 "Martin!" Wass 'voice came through the receivers in both their radios. "Martin, I can't get out!" Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up. 
 
 Wass said, more quietly, "Remember that metal band? It's all clear now, and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a glass wall." 
 
 "We're trapped, we're trapped, they are-" 
 
 "Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check here." 
 
 Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving, toward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings. 
 
 The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette. 
 
 "No go," Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. "I think it must be all around us." He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences of this. Then-"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we separated." 
 
 Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic through the radio receiver against his ear. "What do you suppose caused this?" 
 
 He shook his head angrily, saying, "Judging by reports of the rest of the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of it." 
 
 "Man-made radiation, you mean." 
 
 Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. "Well, alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war." 
 
 Wass 'voice sounded startled. "Anti-radiation screen?" 
 
 Rodney interrupted, "There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen." 
 
 Wass said coldly, "He's right, Martin." 
 
 Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. "You're both wrong," he said. "We landed here today." 
 
 Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at Martin. "The wind-?" 
 
 "Why not?" 
 
 "That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then." Rodney stood straighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer. 
 
 They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass, and stood watching him labor along the metal toward them. 
 
 Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. "I tried to call the ship. No luck." 
 
 "The shield?" 
 
 Wass nodded. "What else?" 
 
 "I don't know-" 
 
 "If we went to the roof of the tallest building," Rodney offered, "we might-" 
 
 Martin shook his head. "No. To be effective, the shield would have to cover the city." 
 
 Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it. "I wonder where it gets its power?" 
 
 "Down below, probably. If there is a down below." Martin hesitated. "We may have to ..." 
 
 "What?" Rodney prompted. 
 
 Martin shrugged. "Let's look." 
 
 He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall buildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and plain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately following his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the corridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings 'facades, and the streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into either side of the corridor. 
 
 It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive. 
 
 Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted downward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch. 
 
 A call from Rodney halted him. "Back here," the tall man repeated. "It looks like a switchboard." 
 
 The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a great arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had come to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining through the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick rope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal roof. 
 
 "Is this it," Wass murmured, "or an auxiliary?" 
 
 Martin shrugged. "The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently." 
 
 "Another assumption," Wass said. "We have done nothing but make assumptions ever since we got here." 
 
 "What would you suggest, instead?" Martin asked calmly. 
 
 Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch. 
 
 "No!" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make. 
 
 Rodney turned. "But-" 
 
 "No. Wass, how much time have we?" 
 
 "The ship leaves in eleven hours." 
 
 "Eleven hours," Rodney repeated. "Eleven hours!" He reached out for the switch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly. 
 
 He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. "What do you think you're doing?" 
 
 "We have to find out what all this stuff's for!" 
 
 "Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves." 
 
 "We've got to-" 
 
 "No!" Then, more quietly-"We still have eleven hours to find a way out." 
 
 "Ten hours and forty-five minutes," Wass disagreed softly. "Minus the time it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow it, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet. And Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin." 
 
 "You too, Wass?" 
 
 "Up to the point of accuracy, yes." 
 
 Martin said, "Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always thinking of your own tender hide, of course." 
 
 Rodney cursed. "And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us that much less time to find a way out. Martin-" 
 
 "Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you stand!" Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. "We all have guns, Martin." 
 
 "I'm holding mine." Martin waited. 
 
 After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly, "He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here." 
 
 "Well ..." Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. "Let's get out of here, then!" 
 
 Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the metal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a halt. "If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must be at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city." 
 
 Rodney said, "To search every building next to the dome clean around the city would take years." 
 
 Martin nodded. "But there must be central roads beneath this main level leading to them. Up here there are too many roads." 
 
 Wass laughed rudely. 
 
 "Have you a better idea?" 
 
 Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, "That leads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for the dome, does it project down into the ground as well?" 
 
 "You mean dig out?" Martin asked. 
 
 "Sure. Why not?" 
 
 "We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no equipment." 
 
 "That shouldn't be hard to come by." 
 
 Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea. 
 
 Rodney said, "They may have had their digging equipment built right in to themselves." 
 
 "Anyway," Martin decided, "we can take a look down below." 
 
 "In the pitch dark," Wass added. 
 
 Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp. The incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet perhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort, gleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the darkness before the men. 
 
 At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city. 
 
 Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example. Metal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down on them. 
 
 Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in a circle. "No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up there?" 
 
 "I don't know. I have no idea." Martin gestured toward the ramp with his light. "Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to you?" 
 
 Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. "Here?" 
 
 "No, no," Martin answered impatiently, "not just here. I mean the whole city." 
 
 "Yes," Wass said dryly, "it does. I'm sure this is where all my nightmares stay when they're not on shift." 
 
 Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he thought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him silently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more so by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the three lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions, past something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another something which could have been anything at all. 
 
 The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall. 
 
 The edge of the city-the city which was a dome of force above and a bowl of metal below. 
 
 After a long time, Wass sighed. "Well, skipper ...?" 
 
 "We go back, I guess," Martin said. 
 
 Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was holding his gun. "To the switchboard, Martin?" 
 
 "Unless someone has a better idea," Martin conceded. He waited. But Rodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was .... Then-"I can't think of anything else." 
 
 They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past the same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all looking different now in the new angles of illumination. 
 
 Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall, matchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty triumph in the rear. 
 
 Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he sighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at surface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and then when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for now. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn. But-The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd ever explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and Martin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at some point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a sort of racial insanity. 
 
 No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be. Viewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity, a faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien metal, which was making him theorize so wildly. 
 
 Then Wass touched his elbow. "Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp." 
 
 Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass. 
 
 "All right," Rodney said belligerently into his radio. "What's holding up the procession?" 
 
 Martin was silent. 
 
 Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It was in Wass 'own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before a bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as the combined light of their torches would reach. 
 
 "Seeds!" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass. 
 
 Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips. 
 
 Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section of the bank. 
 
 Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they wouldn't grow there .... Or had they, once? "Don't, Wass!" 
 
 Torchlight reflected from Wass 'faceplate as he turned his head. "Why not?" 
 
 They were like children ... "We don't know, released, what they'll do." 
 
 "Skipper," Wass said carefully, "if we don't get out of this place by the deadline we may be eating these." 
 
 Martin raised his arm tensely. "Opening a seed bank doesn't help us find a way out of here." He started up the ramp. "Besides, we've no water." 
 
 Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the gun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. "For a plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water. Maybe-" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits "-only the little moisture in the atmosphere." They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side, Rodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear. 
 
 Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was loud and rather uneven in the radio receivers. 
 
 Martin made a final effort. "Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to take off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort." 
 
 Rodney jerked his head negatively. "No. Now, I know you, Martin. Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without us and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate ourselves and God only knows what else and-" 
 
 He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch. 
 
 Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away silently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches. 
 
 The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of Rodney's sobs. 
 
 "Sorry," Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. "Wass?" 
 
 The slight, blond man stood unmoving. "I'm with you, Martin, but, as a last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die gradually-" 
 
 Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. "I agree. As a last resort. We still have a little time." 
 
 Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight, now that he was up again. "Martin, I-" 
 
 Martin turned his back. "Skip it, Rodney," he said gently. 
 
 "Water," Wass said thoughtfully. "There must be reservoirs under this city somewhere." 
 
 Rodney said, "How does water help us get out?" 
 
 Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not looking back. "It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can leave the same way." 
 
 Down the ramp again. 
 
 "There's another ramp," Wass murmured. 
 
 Rodney looked down it. "I wonder how many there are, all told." 
 
 Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down, picking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the present level. "We'll find out," he said, "how many there are." 
 
 Eleven levels later Rodney asked, "How much time have we now?" 
 
 "Seven hours," Wass said quietly, "until take-off." 
 
 "One more level," Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. "I ... think it's the last." 
 
 They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of artificial light on the bottom level of the alien city. 
 
 Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about the floor. "Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are cemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled-" 
 
 "Rodney! Stop it!" 
 
 Rodney swallowed audibly. "This place scares me ..." 
 
 "The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen." 
 
 "This is different," Wass said. "Built-in traps-" 
 
 "They had a war," Martin said. 
 
 Wass agreed. "And the survivors retired here. Why?" 
 
 Martin said, "They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built before the war as a retreat." He turned impatiently. "How should I know?" 
 
 Wass turned, too, persistent. "But the planet was through with them." 
 
 "In a minute," Martin said, too irritably, "we'll have a sentient planet." From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. "Knock it off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know." 
 
 They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow shapes, looking carefully about them. 
 
 Rodney paused. "We might not recognize one." 
 
 Martin urged him on. "You know what a man-hole cover looks like." He added dryly, "Use your imagination." 
 
 They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again, uncertain. 
 
 Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes. 
 
 Wass said, "All this had a purpose, once ..." 
 
 "We'll disperse and search carefully," Martin said. 
 
 "I wonder what the pattern was." 
 
 " ... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later expeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out." 
 
 Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then-"Martin! Martin! I think I've found something!" 
 
 Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind him. 
 
 "Here," Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. "Here. See? Right here." 
 
 Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more from the floor. 
 
 "Well, they had hands." With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of the same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk. 
 
 From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped and turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over. 
 
 "Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?" 
 
 Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily-almost too easily-rotating the disk as it turned. 
 
 Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed hinge. 
 
 The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the six-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that drifted and eddied directly beneath them. 
 
 Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone. "Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!" 
 
 Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the opening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down. 
 
 He was shaking. After a time he said, "Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember the wind? Air currents are moving it." 
 
 Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing. Then-"It wasn't .... Why did you close the hatch then?" 
 
 Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him, otherwise. He said merely, "At first I wasn't sure myself." 
 
 Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun loosely, and his hand shook. "Then prove it. Open it again." 
 
 Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney and he, too, had drawn his gun. 
 
 The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it, outlined in the light of two torches. 
 
 For a little while he was alone. 
 
 Then-causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney-a tenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about Martin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight, obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange objects. Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering spirals. 
 
 Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said nothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and now, himself. 
 
 "How deep," Wass said, from his safe distance. 
 
 "We'll have to lower a flashlight," Martin answered. 
 
 Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a torch swinging wildly on the end of it. 
 
 The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently rolling mounds of fine, white stuff. 
 
 Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip of the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. "You'd rather monkey with the switches and blow yourself to smithereens?" 
 
 Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him disgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into the infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom of the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He stamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing jump. He sank no farther than his knees. 
 
 He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest edge of the city. "I think we'll be all right," he called out, "as long as we avoid the drifts." 
 
 Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney. 
 
 "All right, Wass," Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and sank into the dust. 
 
 "Not me," the answer came back quickly. "You two fools go your way, I'll go mine." 
 
 "Wass!" 
 
 There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening. 
 
 The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied and swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were hard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves. 
 
 "Are we going straight?" Rodney asked. 
 
 "Of course," Martin growled. 
 
 There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination. The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously plunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times without number. 
 
 Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. "The ship leaves in two hours, Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?" 
 
 Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his throat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust, his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed. 
 
 A grate. 
 
 Rodney stared. "Wass!" he shouted. "We've found a way out!" 
 
 Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. "I'm at the switchboard now, Martin. I-" 
 
 There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate. 
 
 The grate groaned upward and stopped. 
 
 Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he began to scream. 
 
 Martin switched off his radio, sick. 
 
 He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall. "Well?" 
 
 "I've been trying to get you," Rodney said, frantically. "Why didn't you answer?" 
 
 "We couldn't do anything for him." 
 
 Rodney's face was white and drawn. "But he did this for us." 
 
 "So he did," Martin said, very quietly. 
 
 Rodney said nothing. 
 
 Then Martin said, "Did you listen until the end?" 
 
 Rodney nodded, jerkily. "He pulled three more switches. I couldn't understand it all. But-Martin, dying alone like that in a place like this-!" 
 
 Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up toward the surface. "Come on, Rodney. Last lap." 
 
 An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the edge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force shimmering, almost invisible, about it. 
 
 Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship. Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members standing by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run toward them. 
 
 "Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe," someone said. It was the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.

Question: The explorers note the metal band around the city and assume that it is there for defense.  What is ironic about the way they opt to proceed?


One of these two answers is correct:
Answer A: They do not believe that the defense mechanism will be engaged, so they venture on.
Answer B: They feel that even though the city could be defended, they do not feel that it will match the defenses they bring with them, thus proceeding.

Consultant: I claim the answer is They do not believe that the defense mechanism will be engaged, so they venture on.
---------------------------------------------

Judge: b more ironic
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: They come upon the metal circle, verbally acknowledge it's defensive, and then stroll right on by without the slightest worry it will activate: <quote>After a time, Wass said, "Here, too. How far do you think it goes?" 
 
 Martin shrugged. "Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it is-was-for." 
 
 "Defense," Rodney, several yards behind, suggested. 
 
 "Could be," Martin said. "Let's go in</quote>

Later: oops! It activated! And now they are trapped inside the city w/o any easy means of escape, since the band turned into a giant dome covering the whole city: <quote>Wass said, more quietly, "Remember that metal band? It's all clear now, and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a glass wall." 
 
 "We're trapped, we're trapped</quote>

It's a slam-dunk vote for A. I'm not sure what the other option really means by "defenses they bring with them" except maybe their sidearms, but they don't factor into the story until well past the encounter / entrapment by the right, and there is certainly no overt discussion of them choosing to proceed because they feel safe b/c they have guns. Happy to quote more around the encounter with the band for as long as you need until you feel confident I am representing the story faithfully.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: A sound pretty good. But I need something explicit about how they don't believe the defense mechanism will be engaged. 
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: Unfortunately, there's no direct "look to camera, say the line" I can quote about it. I can provide context for (a) everything surrounding the first encounter with the metal band, and (b) their thought process when they realize why it was triggered and why they overlooked it triggering before. I'll start with (b) since that's the closest to what you're looking for: <quote>What do you suppose caused this? " 
 
 He shook his head angrily, saying, " Judging by reports of the rest of the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of it. " 
 
 " Man-made radiation, you mean</quote> <quote>"Well, alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war." 
 
 Wass' voice sounded startled. "Anti-radiation screen?" 
 
 Rodney interrupted, "There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years</quote>
<quote>"You're both wrong," he said. "We landed here today</quote> (meaning their rockets triggered the band).

If you want the direct quotes for (a) context, I'll give it next round since I'm at the quote limit.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: I think context for their first encounter with the metal band is definitely more useful. I am a bit confused with the evidence for (b) here. I'm guessing this defense mechanism was an anti-radiation dome type thing. Anything about its purpose? to protect a city?
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: Yep, as far as we can tell from the story it's some kind of antiradiation dome that was triggered when the wind blew radioactive something-or-other from their rockets into the city. I'll add in some elided parts I took out for space which maybe help the explanation flow better (these don't make sense on their own but if you look at the "quotes" tab it should fill in the context I've already quoted): 
<quote>to activate such a screen</quote>
 <quote>Wass said coldly, "He's right, Martin</quote>
Context for initial encounter: <quote>Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the sand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining metal band. 
 
 Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away. "It's here, too."</quote>
[[ two lines of generic dialogue ]]

[[ my initial quote from first speech ]]

<quote>The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street, their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings</quote>

Is there anything else I can explain or quote for you?
---------------------------------------------
Judge: Just for final confirmation what is said right after 743? It looks like you cut off a bit of the quote. Could be just to save some letter count. 
---------------------------------------------
Consultant: It ends in a period, and then a quotation mark: <quote>. "</quote>

But why did you swing the probabilities so much? There is no mention whatsoever of the explorers contemplating their own defenses.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: That's on me swung it the wrong way. Anyways, I don't think I can be completely sure about the answer without explicit evidence how the the group has a conversation along the lines of "yeah this old asf its not gonna activate" but I think you cited quite a bit of evidence all around the context of the group approaching the wall. From what I can tell it seems to suggest that the men did not think much about the defense mechanism and implicitly decided that it wasn't going to activate.
